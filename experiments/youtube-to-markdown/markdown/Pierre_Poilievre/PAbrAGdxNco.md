## Transcript

earlier this week Mark Carney added Mark Weisman uh to his list of adviserss on Canada US relations uh Mark Weisman was the co-founder of the Centry Initiative a lobby group that wants to bring Canada&amp;#39;s population to 100 million people by 2100 can I get your reaction to that and what do you think how do you feel about the idea of rapidly expanding Canada&amp;#39;s population to reach 100 million by the end of the century well it shows that the Liberals would be no different in a fourth term than they were in the first three that the Liberals destroyed our immigration system in their first three terms in power they followed a radical globalist ideology of massive uncontrolled population growth that put strain on our housing market our health care and our job market now corporate elites like Mr wiseman and Mr carney loved it because it drives wages down it takes jobs away from our workers um in numbers that they can&amp;#39;t uh we can&amp;#39;t replace by growth in the job market um but it&amp;#39;s terrible for our working class uh and by bringing on Mr weisman it shows that Mark Carney supports the Liberal Century Initiative to nearly triple our population to 100 million people we put we we voted against the Century Initiative in the House of Commons and the Liberals voted for the Century Initiative unanimously that is the radical liberal agenda on immigration we will have we will get back to moderate reasonable levels of immigration our country was built by common sense immigration but we need to ensure we grow the housing supply our health care and our jobs faster than we grow our population and so I will reject the Century initiative and get back to common sense immigration that brings people to Canada in numbers that we can hire that we can house and that we can care for uh that was the best immigration system in the world and we&amp;#39;re going to bring it home again

## Video Description

Mark Carney's new advisor Mark Wiseman wants Canada to balloon to 100 million people by 2100. Another reason Liberals do not deserve a 4th term.

Conservatives oppose this Liberal Century Initiative. We will cap immigration levels, so we always add jobs, homes & doctors faster than we add people.
