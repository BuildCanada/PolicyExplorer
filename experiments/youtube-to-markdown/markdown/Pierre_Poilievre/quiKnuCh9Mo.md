## Transcript

Canada should be the richest country in the world we have the second biggest land mass in the world the third biggest proven oil reserves six biggest lithium reserves the biggest uranium and potach reserves 154 million Acres of farmland and four coasts that are either on or leading to Tide Water we have an abundance of energy for data centers and cold weather to cool them down we have 41 million Highly Educated brilliant people ready to get it done so why aren&amp;#39;t we the richest country in the world the answer Gatekeepers we can&amp;#39;t get out of our own way it takes more than 17 years to get the average mine approved and built in Canada we have the second slowest permits in the oecd in the first 5 years of this liberal government $176 billion of resource and energy projects were canceled mostly due to government obstacles and ruin ruls these projects would have made us more self-reliant and less dependent on the United States there&amp;#39;s the energy East pipeline that would have brought a million barrels of Western Oil to New Brunswick every single day the company canceled the project after spending a billion dollars on getting it approved after the liberal government suddenly changed the environmental rules another project the northern Gateway would have brought Canadian Oil from Alberta to the Pacific and on to Asia Justin trudo veto showed that one a decision Mark Carney endorsed in testimony at a parliamentary committee not long afterward do you support the prime minister&amp;#39;s decision to veto the northern Gateway pipeline Mr Carney I understand the veto of the northern Gateway pipeline support I think it was sensible I I wasn&amp;#39;t involved in the decision but I think it was the right decision Carney opposed pipelines in Canada while his company bought pipelines in the Middle East and Asia it&amp;#39;s clear that this is not about the environment if it were you&amp;#39;d be consistent and you&amp;#39;d oppose fossil fuels everywhere but you&amp;#39;re happy to profit off of foreign fossil fuel companies while killing jobs among our own people radical liberal keep it in the ground ideology opposes Canadian resources while supporting dirty foreign oil most of all c69 the liberal no new pipelines law makes it effectively impossible to get any project approved the consequence is that the US it&amp;#39;s 97% of our oil exports and 100% of our natural gas exports because we can&amp;#39;t sell to anyone else the Americans rip us off they pay $63 a barrel for our oil while the world price is $76 they pay $4 per million British thermal units while the price in Europe is $15 here&amp;#39;s a simple equation for our liberal friends when you sell something for $4 that is worth 15 you get really poor really fast and because we do not have an East West Pipeline the oil Quebec buys from Alberta must run through American pipelines meaning they could cut us off from ourselves at any time enough let&amp;#39;s build Canada again it&amp;#39;s time to put Canada first it&amp;#39;s time to bring home our jobs energy and economic sovereignty and that is what my bring itome economic plan will do and so today I&amp;#39;m introducing the Canada shovel ready zones Canada shovel ready zones will be areas already permitted for construction here&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;ll get it done first we will identify a spot that makes sense for say a power station LG plant pipeline or other major project second we&amp;#39;ll make sure it is a safe place that won&amp;#39;t harm people or the environment third my government will work with other levels of government to lock down the zoning and permits in advance for we&amp;#39;ll offer pre- permitting before even getting an application so that permits could be published online with a checklist that businesses would have to complete in order to protect nature and people then businesses could buy the land move in hire people and build knowing they already have the permits let me be clear about this it&amp;#39;s not that the permits will simply be faster it&amp;#39;s that they&amp;#39;ll be already done so think of an area that we identify that is perfect perfect for liquefying and exporting gas we would publish a permit online with the normal safety and environmental requirements and then companies could come in immediately buy the rights for it and begin building hiring local First Nations and other Canadians to generate the paychecks in order to liquefy that gas ship it off to Asia in order to break Asian dependence on coal or send it off to Europe to break European dependence on Russian gas turning dollar for dictators and to paychecks for our people we&amp;#39;ll unleash hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in power plants nuclear energy mines pipelines data centers and much more these places will be humming with the sounds of construction equipment as you will see hardworking and talented Canadian workers going around doing the job and expecting big beautiful six figure paychecks to fill their bank accounts welders boiler makers pipe bids Miners and Factory workers will be able to spend those paychecks at local restaurants and other businesses creating even more powerful paychecks the economy will boom raising funds for hospitals and schools most of all we will be less reliant on the Americans in fact we will be self-reliant Sovereign and stand on our own feet to stand up to the Americans and stand up for ourselves for a change and we will restore Canada&amp;#39;s promise that that hard work gets you a great life in a beautiful home on a safe Street protected by solid borders and brave troops under a proud flag Canada let&amp;#39;s bring it home [Music]
