## Transcript

I&amp;#39;d love to ask you actually um the Press uh did uh touch on it so sorry Mr PV as you know the former CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Mark wisman is the co-founder of the century initiative a lobbying group that wants to double Canada&amp;#39;s population to 100 million through immigration driving wages down and housing up making it near impossible to start a family I&amp;#39;m a young Canadian I love to do that um I&amp;#39;m concerned that affordability means longer mortgages in debt instead of Cheaper houses so Pierre will you commit to stopping this crazy social experiment that hurts everybody involved including the immigration or the immigrants lowering the price of homes putting us first the answer is yes absolutely I will stop the insanity I&amp;#39;m against the century initiative I voted against the century initiative in the House of Commons when it came up it&amp;#39;s a radical crazy idea that&amp;#39;s meant for multinational corporate Elites to bring in people from poor countries in large numbers to take away Canadian jobs Drive wages down and profits up and um I love the Immigrant people I want more I want I want people to come here in numbers that can actually be housed yeah employed and cared for like we used to have we used to have a great system and you know people from around the world came here with nothing but about a a dream in a suitcase yeah and it worked but in the last 10 years of of the Liberals it&amp;#39;s gotten totally out of control if we&amp;#39;re growing they&amp;#39;re growing the population by 1.2 million people a year we&amp;#39;re only building 200,000 homes so we&amp;#39;re build we&amp;#39;re at our population is growing three times faster than our housing stock no wonder we can&amp;#39;t get uh anybody people can&amp;#39;t actually get a place to live so I&amp;#39;m going to slow immigration down and I have a very simple mathematical formula the the numbers we let in in in in this year will have to be lower than the number of homes we built in the previous year so we&amp;#39;re always going to be adding homes faster than we add people um and that will allow us to to bring down the housing shortage and get rid of it the housing shortage alog together so that young people can afford a place the other part of that by the way we&amp;#39;ve got to cut the taxes like I&amp;#39;m going to take the GST off new homes we&amp;#39;re going to incentivize the municipalities to speed up permits free up land and cut development charges so that you guys here at Luna can help build more homes you&amp;#39;ll be laying the foundation on those homes but you&amp;#39;ll also be able to afford to live in them thank you you agree with that yes all right thank you thank you very much [Applause]

## Video Description

Mark Wiseman, co-founder of the Century Initiative, is also an advisor to Mark Carney.

The Century Initiative is a radical group that wants to increase Canada's population to 100 million by 2100. I will stop it.

A Conservative government will fix our immigration system and oppose the radical project of the Century Initiative.
