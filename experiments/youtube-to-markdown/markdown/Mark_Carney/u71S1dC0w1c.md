## Transcript

rescheduled meeting uh to discuss uh the situation in our economy how we can work together across a range of industries forestry aerospace automobiles and beyond During the course of that meeting uh President Trump announced 25% tariffs against our auto industry Uh and this is a a direct attack to be clear a direct attack on the very workers that I stood in front of uh uniforers I stood in front of uh this morning uh at the Ambassador Bridge A bridge is a symbol uh and a reality up until now of the tight ties uh between our two countries ties of kinship ties of commerce uh ties that are in the process of being broken We will defend our workers We&amp;#39;ll defend our companies We will defend our country And we will defend it together You know this will hurt us but through this period by being together we will emerge stronger I think what&amp;#39;s happened and this was part of our discussion over the course of the last several months Canadian workers Canadians as a whole across this country have gotten over the shock of the betrayal and are learning lessons We have to look out for ourselves and we have to look out for each other and work together for each other And I just want to say a few words before taking some questions about what my government has done to turn that sentiment into reality We made a commitment a few weeks ago to use every dollar that we collect from intalitatory tariffs to support workers to directly go to support workers And last week we made a series of changes to the EI system in order to take the first big step to make good uh on that promise There&amp;#39;ll be more We&amp;#39;ve announced of course retaliatory tariffs We have other options for those retaliatory tariffs I have asked for a meeting I will convene rather a meeting of the Canada US uh uh cabinet tomorrow to discuss our trade options But we&amp;#39;re also providing the option of major liquidity for our companies Uh we put in place an ability for companies to delay tax payments We&amp;#39;ve put in place a large facility for our largest companies some of them which may be affected by this would be affected by this ought to draw in liquidity in various forms so that they can take longer term decisions without undue pressure from short-term unjustified actions It&amp;#39;s also why we focused in part in anticipation of what might happen uh on today&amp;#39;s announcement that I made in front of that uh ambassador bridge uh for the $2 billion strategic response fund And the point of that fund the point of government procurement the point of linking up through supply chains the point of working with labor led by Unifor is to build a made in Canada supply chain a made in Canada option so that we are less affected uh by these Now that will take time Uh but we&amp;#39;re already putting in place the building uh blocks for that To be clear we are standing together standing for Canadian workers across levels of government And I would add that uh Premier Ford and I uh have discussed this already at length and we will have more discussions in terms of uh in terms of our overall approach But together we are stronger Canada And with that I think we have time for two questions before I go to my next event this evening I will concern Do you have any clarity on how Canada will be impacted and how parts will be treated and how will you respond yeah this is a crucial question I&amp;#39;ll give a short answer We do not yet have the executive order and so there are different variants of the 25% announcement uh that was made today One would be that it is only on the this is still significant to be absolutely clear but on the part component of a car Another would be that it&amp;#39;s on the entire vehicle Uh we await the executive order for that clarity Uh but to be absolutely clear even in the more quote restricted version of this uh it is a significant uh action It&amp;#39;s entirely unjustified is entirely inconsistent uh with uh Kuzma uh and indeed the long history of uh relations uh in the auto sector right back through the auto pact Okay Uh just Okay Serious not on the Lord executive commercial Okay Wait for Elector Canada American president Uh yeah I I I think uh it would be appropriate uh that the president and I speak given the action that he&amp;#39;s taken Uh I&amp;#39;m sure that will happen soon I&amp;#39;m not going to give you a precise timing on that In terms of uh options which was the second part of Miss Martin&amp;#39;s question Uh even during uh a caretaker period of government we have anticipated this possibility uh we have put in place the mechanisms so that if it is appropriate for retaliatory tariffs and there&amp;#39;s many considerations uh to be taken in in in those regards and I want to have the meeting of our of our cabinet uh Canada US cabinet other considerations we need to see the details of the executive order uh but we will take the steps that are in the interests of Canadian workers of Canada we are going to stand up for Canada we&amp;#39;re going to be united Um and uh we will fight uh in a unified way And I would say uh if I may and I will and Lana can and Miss Payne can speak for herself obviously uh the discussions that we&amp;#39;ve had the discussions I&amp;#39;ve had with Premier Ford um are we we&amp;#39;re entirely aligned uh in terms of the seriousness with which we&amp;#39;re taking this and the seriousness of our response Thank you very much
