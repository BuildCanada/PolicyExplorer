okay thank you Jim hello mercy uh thank you Jim tul I just I&amp;#39;m going to start this is what Canada Strong looks like this is what Canada Strong is and I am I&amp;#39;m thrilled to be joined by Nova Scotia MPs and candidates Shannon Darren Lena Haimey Cody Jessica Braden and Elena and this is what a strong government looks like behind me thank you very much everyone for joining it um you know I don&amp;#39;t have to be asked twice uh to come to Halifax in fact I insist on coming to Halifax i&amp;#39;ve been coming here for decades for for vacations for business i love jogging in Point Pleasant Park dining on Argyle Street in fact I can&amp;#39;t exhaust all the restaurants um and it&amp;#39;s great to be back in Nova Scotia for today&amp;#39;s uh announcement uh because it ties in with the province&amp;#39;s long history with the sea and its proud legacy of ship building from Yarmouth to Piku from Lunenburgg and of course here to Halifax distra Canada liberty humanity halifax Canada [Music] it&amp;#39;s workers like those around me and behind me who have made this city this province and this country what it is today you those who came before you forged our very history and you are building our future whenever Canada is in need workers such as here at the Irving Shipyard have stepped up and I want to say thank you and my colleagues want to say thank you on behalf of a grateful nation and we need you because these are challenging times our world is changing it&amp;#39;s becoming more divided and dangerous our adversaries are increasingly emboldened and the norms that have kept Canada and the world secure are in peril the priorities of the United States once closely aligned to our own have shifted our sovereignty is under threat may leaf president Trump wants to break us so America can own us we will not let that happen you know as Canadians we&amp;#39;re over the shock of the betrayal but we should never forget the lessons we have to look out for ourselves and we have to look out for each other and that&amp;#39;s what Canadians do and that&amp;#39;s what my government is doing during this crisis we&amp;#39;re acting to protect workers workers affected by the tariffs we&amp;#39;re using every dollar collected from our retaliatory tariffs to protect those workers as I announced last week because we know that we are stronger when we are together we cannot let anyone not American politicians or Canadian politicians make us angry or divided while President Trump&amp;#39;s plan is to divide and conquer Pierre Puv&amp;#39;s plan is to divide and be conquered his negative slogans aren&amp;#39;t solutions his anger isn&amp;#39;t action his division is in strength negativity won&amp;#39;t win a trade war negativity won&amp;#39;t pay the rent or the mortgage negativity won&amp;#39;t bring down the price of groceries negativity won&amp;#39;t make Canada strong and and the first part of Canada strong it means an armed forces that are well resourced and has those very resources at the ready and we&amp;#39;re here I&amp;#39;m here to make that happen our military is still underfunded under the last Conservative government when Pierre PV was a minister that government and shamefully abandon our veterans closing area offices across Canada since then Canada has doubled down on our national ship building strategy which right here in Halifax is creating good paying union jobs for Canadian workers [Applause] yes we are modernizing NORAD investing in new technologies and working with new partners including Australia and I made an announcement in Nunvet last week to protect Canadians we are building new military installations and increasing the presence of Canadian armed forces in the Arctic to defend our sovereignty the North and those who call it home and since the end of Pierre Polyv&amp;#39;s conservative government defense spending has more than doubled i repeat defense spending has more than doubled in the last decade but it&amp;#39;s not enough for the new environment we&amp;#39;re in and that&amp;#39;s why today I&amp;#39;m announcing my plan to rebuild reinvest and rearm we will expand the capabilities of the Navy with new submarines and additional heavy ice breakers to defend the North we will deliver an unprecedented acceleration of investment in our armed forces so that we can defend every inch of our sovereign territory while helping to support and defend our allies abroad the national ship building strategy that&amp;#39;s over 21,000 jobs across the country including 9,500 right here in Halifax and Dartmouth supported each year through the construction of eight Arctic and offshore patrol ships and 15 riverclass destroyers this is crucial this is crucial but you know when I was uh just take a moment um when I was uh had the pleasure of taking the tour uh with with Nancy Lockhart um I met a young apprentice uh Victoria who said this gives me a career and that&amp;#39;s a key message we are building for the long term we&amp;#39;re building Canada strong not for an election cycle but to protect Canadians we&amp;#39;re building for the long term and these people behind me their children their friends their neighbors have careers in ship building to protect this great country um now we have more to do in the immediate term we will move immediately to fill the Canadian Armed Forces shortage of over 14,000 members by modernizing our recruitment process giving Canadian Forces members a raise building new onbase housing improving access to doctors mental health services and child care and we&amp;#39;ll ensure And we&amp;#39;ll ensure that Canadian troops defending Canada at home have the same equipment capabilities as those defending our allies abroad we will expand the reach and the ability of the Canadian Coast Guard and integrate them into our NATO defense capabilities we will give the Canadian Coast Guard a new mandate and the right equipment to conduct maritime surveillance to secure our coast we will also create first class drone capability that will build and deploy aquatic and airborne uncrrewed vehicles to defend our Arctic our undersea infrastructure our borders and yes our allies and when doing this we will ensure as much as possible that Canadian companies Canadian companies benefit from Canadian procurements an end to sending dollar after dollar south of the border to a nation that is threatening us they will use Canadian steel and aluminum they will use Canadian suppliers and companies they will use and employ Canadian workers and and that&amp;#39;s all part of a broader modernization of how we procure we will modernize our procurement legislation so that our forces can buy equipment when they need and what they need which is now now we don&amp;#39;t want any more excuses for leaving funds on the table when we need to strengthen our defenses every dollar will be focused on value for money ensuring we make wise investments in building our capabilities and getting us to our 2% NATO NATO target before 2030 our sovereignty faces the greatest threats in generations the world is becoming more divided and dangerous and this plan will help ensure that Canada is strong at home strong abroad my government is building arming and investing in the Canadian Armed Forces my government is stepping up and fighting for Canada we&amp;#39;re defending our borders our sovereignty our minerals our water our land our way of life canada for finally this is the most consequential election of our lifetimes and my government is meeting the moment with purpose and with force canadians want solutions not slogans they want positive action not anger they want calm not chaos they want strength not division they want a government that will fight for them my government is doing that and we always will because we know that together together we are Canada strong merciu thank you now I&amp;#39;ll take your question thank you prime minister thank you prime minister we&amp;#39;ll now begin the question period we&amp;#39;ll take question from the delegation and then a few local questions at the very end first question good morning good morning steve Chase with the Globe and Mail we have a story today in the paper about India&amp;#39;s efforts to meddle in the last conservative leadership race now your predecessor had asked Pierre Polyvra to get a security b uh clearance so he could obtain briefings about threats you of course have obtained a security clearance you&amp;#39;ve been briefed and that brings me to my question just before the election you removed a three-term liberal candidate from the riding of Nepian Chandra Arya uh that&amp;#39;s a very serious decision and a very drastic decision you&amp;#39;ve been briefed can you tell us why this was necessary and did it have something to do with his close relations with the Modi government in India uh thank you for your question Steve um let me say a few things uh the first is that I find it beyond baffling i find it downright irresponsible that the leader of the opposition day after day month after month year after year refuses to obtain his security clearance as a normal course in peace time when times were tranquil that&amp;#39;s unacceptable then but at this point in our history when we face the greatest threats that we&amp;#39;ve faced in generations in most of our lifetimes uh he has to answer for that and he particularly has to answer for that given the reporting that understand you did uh you and your colleagues did today um and the lack of integrity in the conservative leadership race now I will observe that in the Liberal leadership race every effort was made to protect the integrity of that race including I&amp;#39;ll be frank quite an ownorous technical system for voting to verify identity location so that that was held up and some people couldn&amp;#39;t vote because of that we decided to take that risk because we wanted the highest integrity for that race as part of that process of course there were reviews of uh candidates and suitability myself included appropriately and certain information came to light i&amp;#39;m not privy to the exact information it&amp;#39;s a separate process certain candidates were disqualified from that race that information was relevant to the decision of what is a separate body within the Liberal Party the it was called a green light committee that made the decision to disqualify Mr arya i can assure you that information that we have I&amp;#39;m saying broadly as a party not me personally because I don&amp;#39;t have this specific information uh is shared with the relevant authorities we take this incredibly serious Steve I want to make one other point if I may and I&amp;#39;ll hand back um one of the acts uh that I took uh as prime minister in the nine days be between being sworn in and uh uh uh asking the governor general to dissolve parliament and call this election was to strengthen the critical election incident protocol it&amp;#39;s a protocol that had been put in place a few years ago but various measures to strengthen that and also to encourage greater transparency from that group during the election campaign so that if issues arise during the election campaign in their independent judgment uh that they will share with all Canadians um and uh ensure that Canadians have the confidence which I have at this point the full confidence in the integrity of the federal election process i&amp;#39;ll hand back Say the chef Okay extraordinary chef okay [Music] electoral integrity committee uh actual see follow-up question it&amp;#39;s about your defense announcement today um the reason we asked for specifics is so we can track later whether you&amp;#39;re living up to your pledges you&amp;#39;ve talked about submarines how many submarines is it the 12 the Navy wants is it less than that how many extra heavy ice breakers are they able to break year round ice are they slush breakers what do you have in mind you talk about pay raise for the forces you talk about a a underwater drone fleet can we get any detail at all on any of this what what what we&amp;#39;re going to do Steve um is and it&amp;#39;s the right question or followup um is we will be laying out in the platform uh the specifics of all the specifics we can at this stage respecting commercial confidentiality uh when I not confidentiality commercial considerations because with particularly with respect to the submarines uh these are contracts to be negotiated they are measured in the tens and tens of billions of dollars uh in terms of ultimate uh costs for the submarines um and we don&amp;#39;t want to put the Canadian taxpayer at a disadvantage by being overly specific or prescriptive on the precise aspects of that with respect to the other ships though we will be specific with respect to the salary uh increase we will be specific with respect to uh the overall defense spend the diff and the differentiation between operating and capital spend but how the overall defense spend as a percentage of GDP which is a relevant number for some how that changes um with these measures and more we have we will have more defense announcements uh with the platform and and before the platform comes out so we will lay all that out as well uh we will we will cost our broader um our our broader uh electoral platform so you can see uh you can see the the balance of fiscal and how we&amp;#39;re how we&amp;#39;re balancing the budget so okay No [Music] um chef chef [Music] in English please uh well I said that sorry uh that um you know why not if we have a debate with all the leaders of the parties uh I now realize that the leader of the Greens were not invited there are two leaders of the Green Party as you know as well we have the debates uh which I look forward to uh overseen by the electoral commission u in French and in English the 16th and 17th are the dates i look forward to uh I look forward to those debates and I&amp;#39;ll add that uh look um I have spent during my leadership campaign I spent more time in Quebec than any other province um I I&amp;#39;m going there in two days um I have uh engaged on [Music] I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m very much out in the open janice Marco the the candid the candidate exact that&amp;#39;s it good morning Ashley Brook CBC News can you give us an update on your review of the purch purchase of the F-35 fighter jets with the US and you&amp;#39;re here at Irving they&amp;#39;ll be building Canada&amp;#39;s new destroyers will you commit to a a review of the US-made combat system on those warships yeah okay uh thank you Ashley so in terms of the F-35 um as you know I asked the Minister of Defense a little more than a week ago to review u that contract to be absolutely clear whether it&amp;#39;s the F-35 or an alternative aircraft that is doing the best job to defend our country getting the best value for money and part of that value for money includes the maximum economic impact here in Canada we&amp;#39;re here at the Irving shipyard you can see the economic impact of this contract uh you can feel it literally in the room uh with the individuals with the supply chains and and the and the effects beyond um so on the F-35 It&amp;#39;s a question first and foremost as it is for all of these investments is it making Canada more secure and is it doing so in the most effective way um we have alternatives to the F-35 uh so we will explore those as the minister of defense um and procurement will explore how the F-35 program could be adjusted including uh greater investment here in Canada greater production here in Canada uh in ways that have that maximum economic impact as well as uh securing us in terms of uh in terms of the combat uh systems look there is a high degree of interoperability as you know uh between uh Canada and the US our forces it&amp;#39;s been built up over decades um and that extends to uh the material um and and our weapon systems um we are increasingly deliberate about the costs and benefits or the risks and benefits of that interoperability um the United States is still a strong ally uh it is still uh member of NATO um and we see advantages but actually in all aspects of our procurement uh we will be thinking about how to secure Canadians and how to have the maximum benefit for Canadians because that is what will make Canada strong okay okay so no review on the combat systems and can you give us an um and as well um there&amp;#39;s a report that members of Trump&amp;#39;s cabinet and senior security advisers discussed a secret war plan in a group chat that included a reporter from the Atlantic in light of that do you have any concerns about Canada sharing confidential information with the US i think that um you know I uh have had in various guys&amp;#39;s u top secret security clearance here in Canada elsewhere I have it again um I&amp;#39;m aware that from time to time information leaks it&amp;#39;s a serious serious issue um uh and all lessons must be taken from any of those including in in this circumstance um we have a very strong intelligence partnership with the Americans through five eyes uh mistakes do happen but what&amp;#39;s important is how people react to those mistakes and how they tighten them up they don&amp;#39;t deny the mistakes but they are clear and transparent in addressing them um but I&amp;#39;ll just say one other thing if I may about the broad thrust of your question if I may interpret it our responsibility my responsibility is to plan for the worst is to think about the most difficult uh evolution of the new threat environment what it means for Canada and how do we best protect Canada and part of that response is to be more and more Canadian in our defense capabilities more and more Canadian in our decisions to take greater ownership as I said in my remarks and you&amp;#39;ve heard me say this before um we have to look out for ourselves hi Brian Platt with Bloomberg News we&amp;#39;re eight days out from Donald Trump&amp;#39;s next stated tariff deadline of April 2nd we know you have not spoken with the president yet since you uh took office what is your government&amp;#39;s engagement strategy uh ahead of April 2nd with the White House and will any ministers or officials be traveling to Washington before April 2nd well I think two things Brian one is that the ministers uh the Minister of International Trade Mr llah the minister of foreign affairs uh Madame Jolie the minister of finance uh the minister of national security others are in contact with their counterparts okay um first point second is we have learned uh and others have learned over time that there is an unpredictability to US trade policy uh there is certainly an opacity to US trade policy so what how does one respond to that what you do is you again you prepare for the worst um and part of that is what we have done in the last weeks we have made substantial changes to our unemployment insurance program to support Canadian workers we unlike the Conservative Party which is going to use the tariff revenues for tax cuts use everything for tax cuts by the way um we are going to use uh retaliatory tariff revenues to protect Canadian workers who reinvest there we have put in place major uh financial uh support mechanisms for Canadian companies uh we&amp;#39;ve allowed them we are going to allow them to defer tax payments also for liquidity purposes uh we put in support mechanisms uh Cody is behind me uh for the minister of agriculture is behind me support mechanisms uh in the agriculture sector as well so we&amp;#39;ve taken a number of precautionary measures so that we can react quickly there we also have in place a schedule of goods that we for which we can add retaliatory tariffs to uh on April 2nd depending on what the Americans do so we have done that work and have the ability to put those uh tariffs in place um and you know with respect to um with respect to the president um the point is to have substantive discussions the point is not theater the point is to get serious sovereign nation to sovereign nation that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re looking for in terms of putting this trading relationship back on a new path uh a new path that works best for Canada given the unreliability of America in terms of if new tariffs are put on Canada on April 2nd in terms of a response you&amp;#39;ve pointed to the the counter tariff list that was already prepared are there any non-tariff measures that are on the table next week for Canada and I&amp;#39;m thinking particularly export controls or export taxes uh the um I would I would focus on those measures are options for uh for Canada i&amp;#39;ll speak in general for Canada um but the tariff response um in the near term is severalfold one is what I everything I just mentioned I won&amp;#39;t repeat on protection for workers and firms and others secondly retaliatory tariffs in a way that has maximum impact on America and minimum impact here on Canada so we&amp;#39;ll be very deliberate on that thirdly it&amp;#39;s Canadian procurement a greater focus on Canadian procurement uh and you will have heard in my announcement today this focus on Canadian steel and aluminum and of course Irving uh can be a big part of that as we build out fourthly all the measures to build our economy strong and you know I that&amp;#39;s why the federal provincial meeting last Friday was so important because that commitment to move to free trade in Canada with the federal government my government committing that we will remove federal barriers by Canada Day uh legislate to remove those barriers by this this is huge i mean look the people behind me uh have uh great uh skilled trades and actually they have uh they have a whole career ahead of them given the ship building uh contracts but some of them for family reasons or other reasons might want to move to Alberta for a job you know they&amp;#39;re mechanical engineers or they&amp;#39;re electrical engineers or they&amp;#39;re skilled welders trades people they might want to move to Alberta BC the Northwest Territories for some opportunity we&amp;#39;re going to make sure that they can do it like that okay that&amp;#39;s a different thing so all of that doesn&amp;#39;t sound like a trade response but it is a trade response and I&amp;#39;ll and I&amp;#39;ll put it again this is this is doing it because it&amp;#39;s right for Canada we&amp;#39;re in charge of our destiny but the other thing it does is it shows the Americans that we&amp;#39;re strong and we&amp;#39;re going to get stronger while they get weaker because they are inflicting harm on themselves with these tariffs and that is going to put us in a better place for negotiations when they come and that is a crucial point we&amp;#39;re not rushing to the table to take something serious discussions sovereign nation to sovereign nation comprehensive Canada strong against America as equals and that&amp;#39;s when we will get the best deal for Canada yeah local media your mic isn&amp;#39;t on i think I think you said last question last question before turning to local media okay thank you on the media local okay yes for the party okay not not platform okay don&amp;#39;t okay [Music] the difference that&amp;#39;s good as elimin elimin elimin eliminate canada extreme system force Canada augmentity force Canadian okay to the local delegation please we&amp;#39;ll do one question yeah hi Taran Grant with CBC Nova Scotia uh my colleagues just reported that Shawn Frasier has changed his mind and will be um taking the nomination in central Nova Scotia why do you think it&amp;#39;s justified to allow former politicians to take a nomination when another candidate has already been named uh first thing Sean Fraser is an exceptional public servant and he took a decision to uh for family reasons to withdraw from public life and I respected that i regretted it but I respected it i and my colleagues have wanted Shawn Frasier to come back and serve Canada at this crucial time shawn stepping up for our country if that indeed is what he&amp;#39;s going to announce later today and I don&amp;#39;t know the case if that indeed is what he&amp;#39;s going to announce uh later today is exceptionally good news for Canada and it is a symbol it&amp;#39;s another sign rather of what you see behind me with these great candidates and we see across this country of exceptional people stepping up for the Liberal Party at the country&amp;#39;s time of need and I think you&amp;#39;ll find that um everyone in the Liberal Party in Central Nova including uh prospective candidate uh is thrilled uh if Shawn is indeed going to be our candidate but you&amp;#39;ll have to wait a few more hours to find that determination thank you Mr fraser colleague comments next question prime Minister uh Ella Macdonald Global News Halifax affordability in our province specifically when it comes to housing and rent is a major challenge for Nova Scotians in Halifax people are struggling to afford a roof over their heads and in other areas of the province what would your government do to address this issue of affordability for Nova Scotians okay i&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m very pleased you raised the issue and you know part of the challenge of the affordability here as you know uh being on the ground is in part because of the success of Halifax in recent years a lot of people coming to Halifax um but the system is is straining uh and the housing system is straining uh and affordability in particularly with respect to housing is uh exceptionally difficult absolutely know that so what are we doing um we&amp;#39;re doing several things in the immediate term uh we are this is a permanent change but we are eliminating GST uh for first-time uh home buyers and that is a savings of up to uh $50,000 off the price of the home uh and so you know you&amp;#39;re thinking around a third of the purchases are first-time home buyers for new and uh substantially renovated homes so that&amp;#39;s the first thing the second thing is we unlike the conservatives uh are focused on supply so one of the biggest impacts on supply is something that we go back to uh Mr frasier just mentioned that he put in place as minister of housing uh is the housing accelerator fund which is a very effective way it&amp;#39;s proving very effective here in Halifax Quebec City Saskatoon across the country to um get what are called development charges down uh accelerate the building of that but the third thing that needs to happen and I&amp;#39;m just going to ask for your patience uh for a couple of more days is we need to build affordable housing at a scale we haven&amp;#39;t seen since the Second World War my government is going to do that thank you last question dism hello my name is uh Angel Moore APN National News uh here in Nova Scotia the uh fishery is uh very important to all people uh just recently uh three MIGMA leaderships of uh Sebagani Milbrook and Member 2 First Nation say they do not need uh DFO or federal authorization and they are going to fish uh to assert their inherit uh Aboriginal rights uh do you support this uh what I support is um is dialogue which balances um Aboriginal rights uh the realities of the fishery uh that works towards a sustainable fishery um here in Nova Scotia uh throughout Atlantic Canada across across this country um and it&amp;#39;s one of many reasons why I&amp;#39;m proud to be standing up here with Jaime Batista um and as well as Darren Fischer and well as the whole group because what we bring and this is a this is a core point this is a fundamental point what the Liberal Party is bringing to this election is all of Canada whether it&amp;#39;s a Sean Fraser Jaime Batista Darren Fischer okay I&amp;#39;m going to get in trouble lena um and beyond everyone behind me and beyond from different walks of life from different experiences different perspectives coming together to work out problems and so we need that and and this is this has been fundamental for me is to make sure that we have a liberal team that has at the front line the MPs that are putting themselves forward that has that breadth of experience so we&amp;#39;re not just relying on the civil service as good as the civil service is and we&amp;#39;re not just relying on consultations um with with stakeholder groups um and I would add as well just on the last point um it was my um it was my privilege uh as prime minister to meet with uh the leaders of the national indigenous organizations last Friday and you know I made a point final final point uh I made a point both in signal and in substance um in my first days as prime minister of going back to the founding peoples of this country uh the core founding peoples of course are the indigenous peoples of Canada uh but also uh recognizing France president meeting with the United Kingdom so with that thank you for your questions and are you the last local person can we feel that yeah two minutes please thank you Mr carney yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna let very quick Mr i&amp;#39;m Jacob Moore with Acadia Broadcasting um we have stations in parts of the province that really really rely on fisheries and being sandwiched between the tariffs of from China and the US what will you tell people who rely on that who are worried about their jobs disappearing well look first is um very focused on I met with the minister of fisheries and oceans um two days ago 36 hours ago uh going through a number of issues around that this uh we have put in place a series of measures to protect workers uh engagement with both the Americans Chinese on these issues something we discussed at uh at first ministers look we&amp;#39;re going to fight we&amp;#39;re going to fight for the fishery we&amp;#39;re fighting for a sustainable uh fishery uh it&amp;#39;s integral look these are people&amp;#39;s livelihoods it&amp;#39;s also it&amp;#39;s part of who we are as Canadians it&amp;#39;s part of our core identity um and so no greater priority so the message is we&amp;#39;re there and again we have we have representation and it&amp;#39;s very important to have that representation at the table fighting for uh those uh individuals and and we&amp;#39;re going to do everything we can to support the fishery through this period and for the medium term thank you very much thank you this is my fin
