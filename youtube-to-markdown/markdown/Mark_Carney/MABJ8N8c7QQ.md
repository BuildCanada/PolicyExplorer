okay no warm up no warm up good morning everyone hello everyone um thank you all for being here uh it&amp;#39;s a pleasure to be in Windsor uh it&amp;#39;s pleasure to be back um it&amp;#39;s great to be in the home of the uh of the Spitfires I want to be home of the Spitfires there we go yeah go spits and actually go spits they&amp;#39;re in the they&amp;#39;re in the playoffs right they&amp;#39;re going to have a good run continuing in the uh tradition of Al Arbor and Glenn Hall and Marcel prono um and it&amp;#39;s great uh to be here with our two fantastic liberal candidates Chris Sutton uh and Eric kmer and above all it&amp;#39;s great to be here in the home of the Canadian Auto industry you know we&amp;#39;re here today because of who&amp;#39;s behind me uh proud uniform unifor members union members men and women who are the backbone of the Canadian autom manufacturing sector and because they&amp;#39;re at the backbone of that sector they are the Cornerstone of the Windsor economy and they&amp;#39;re what make Canada strong and we&amp;#39;re also here because of what&amp;#39;s over there and what it represents the Ambassador Bridge a bridge that for almost a almost a century has stood as a symbol of cooperation and of Peace it&amp;#39;s also been a symbol of the greatest friendship between two countries the world has ever seen and it&amp;#39;s more than a symbol it carries a quarter of all Goods traded between Canada and the United States one quarter of all Goods that is $140 billion every year it is $400 million every single day it&amp;#39;s an extraordinary achievement it&amp;#39;s an extraordinary friendship and economic partnership [Music] president Trump&amp;#39;s trade War has put the kinship that exists between our great Nations under greater strain than at any point in our storied histories and his trade war is hurting and it will hurt more American consumers and workers I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low today and those American workers and consumers should be president Trump&amp;#39;s concern but his trade War also threatens to work and hurt hardworking Canadians the people I care about the people we care about it threatens union workers like those behind me from unior those down the 401 at auto assembly plants in ingersol and Oshawa and Oakville it threatens people in Hamilton working in the steel mills and up in the sagon at the aluminum smelters and like hundreds of thousands of Canadians who just want to earn a good paycheck and build a good life it&amp;#39;s understandable that Canadians are anxious and that&amp;#39;s why our new government has committed to use all of the revenues from our retaliatory tariffs against the United States use all of those revenues to support Canadian workers we&amp;#39;ve already turned that commitment into action to support workers we have temporarily waved the onewe employment insurance waiting period we&amp;#39;ve changed the rules so the workers don&amp;#39;t have to exhaust severance pay before collecting EI we&amp;#39;ve made it easier to access SEI and we&amp;#39;ve made it more generous I have announced that a new liberal government will put more money in Canadians Pockets through a middle class tax cut a tax cut that will save a two income family up to $825 a year because we know we&amp;#39;re stronger together because we know that and we know that we&amp;#39;re all in this together Healthcare in Canada is a right not a big business like it is across the river because we&amp;#39;re all in this together our government has created $10 a day child care for hardworking families so that both Partners can work because we&amp;#39;re all in it together we&amp;#39;ve created the Canadian dental care plan that&amp;#39;s already served 1.8 million Canadians and is poised to serve more than 5 million more we know we must do more and what I want to focus on not surprisingly is our Auto industry Autos are our number two export in this country it is a sector that supports 125,000 jobs directly and almost another 500,000 jobs in related Industries many of them good union jobs we have over 3,300 vehicles that roll off our assembly lines every single day and the workers who build them contribute over $6 million in taxes every single day Canadian Auto Workers don&amp;#39;t just build Vehicles they build Canada and our Auto sector has always been there for our country so in this time of uncertainty in need Canada will be there for our Auto Workers that is why today I&amp;#39;m announcing that the new liberal government will create the Strategic response fund and this is a $2 billion fund that will protect the jobs of workers affected by President Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs but it&amp;#39;ll do much more than that it will fortify the entire Canadian auto supply chain from raw materials to finished Vehicles because we&amp;#39;re not just protecting the present we&amp;#39;re looking to build the future we&amp;#39;re creating new jobs under our plan we will build an all-in Canada Network for autom manufacturing components because on average an auto part crosses that border often through that bridge over that bridge six times before final assembly and in a trade War that&amp;#39;s a huge vulnerability tariff as it goes into the United States each time so what we need to do is build more of those autos and more of each Auto right here in Canada in the new world that will be an advantage that will help insulate us from president Trump&amp;#39;s trade threats and it&amp;#39;ll grow the economy right here in Wind to rails and Roads will&amp;#39;ll also establish a one window approval process that means eliminating duplicative Federal requirements now building will include building out critical minerals in the ring of fire in partnership with indigenous peoples it will include building out our ports reinforcing and building the port of Montreal and Newports like Grey&amp;#39;s Bay in nunit we will create complete Supply chains for the future of our Auto industry and new markets for it to sell into finally I&amp;#39;m committing that a new liberal government will buy Canadian V vehicles to grow our Auto industry and create more we are building we are building Canada strong and our actions are supporting the work of nearly half a million we&amp;#39;re supporting their communities we&amp;#39;re supporting this great country that&amp;#39;s the thing that President Trump just doesn&amp;#39;t get he wants to break us so America can own us and it will never ever happen because we don&amp;#39;t just look out for ourselves we look out for each other that&amp;#39;s what unions do that&amp;#39;s what the liberal government is doing together we will make Canada strong now there is another person who just doesn&amp;#39;t get it and that&amp;#39;s Pier POV cont leadership positive we&amp;#39;re stronger together negative slogans aren&amp;#39;t Solutions anger isn&amp;#39;t action division isn&amp;#39;t strength Pi pov&amp;#39;s approach for division sounds familiar doesn&amp;#39;t it that&amp;#39;s because as premier Smith said and I quote Pierre PV is very much in sync with President Trump and someone who worships Donald Trump will kneel down before him not stand up to him negativity won&amp;#39;t win a trade War it won&amp;#39;t pay the rent or the mortgage and negativity won&amp;#39;t bring down the price of groceries it won&amp;#39;t protect good union jobs negativity won&amp;#39;t make Canada strong you know finally this is the most consequential election of our lifetimes and Canadians have a clear choice my government is meeting the moment with per purpose with partnership and with force and together under a new liberal government we will build a stronger and more resilient Auto industry we will build and create more higher pain union jobs we will build the strongest economy in the G7 we will build Canada strong May C thank you very much and I look forward to your questions thank you thank you prime minister we&amp;#39;ll now take questions we&amp;#39;ll take about 15 minutes of questions from the delegation and then local media Z see Brookfield Brookfield [Music] onario method [Music] no no uh uh the uh the structure of these funds is designed to benefit the Pension funds the Canadian Pension funds that invest in them the cast Depo Ontario teachers as two examples the beneficiaries of those Pension funds teachers retirees Municipal Employees they pay the taxes on their on their pension that&amp;#39;s the design uh the follow-up is uh how do I know I understand how uh the world works and these structure works and uh have the uh ability to put in place uh all of the necessary rules to ensure that the appropriate taxes are paid here in Canada as is the case in the example that you just gave the taxes are paid Canada okay back off hi Mr Carney Tom Perry with CBC I I could just follow up on that could you explain in that in the case of those Brookfield funds like what was the argument for registering the funds in Bermuda um is it ethical to do that and is it something as prime minister that you&amp;#39;d have to crack down on I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s a problem but is that something that you&amp;#39;d have to crack down on I think the important thing uh Tom is that the flow through of the funds go to the go to Canadian entities who then pay the uh pay the taxes appropriately as opposed to taxes being paid multiple times uh before they get there so that&amp;#39;s how we have the structure that&amp;#39;s the structure that all of our Pension funds pamp the C Depo uh or Ontario teachers or omers Municipal Employees or all the big Pension funds in Canada which are very successful which protect uh union workers in many cases I&amp;#39;m speaking of union workers today and suppli to them that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s those entities and th their employees uh who are covered so the structures work for that effect what&amp;#39;s the advantage though of putting it into a place like it ensures that it ensures that the the it&amp;#39;s an efficiency of a structure so that ensures that the flow through goes to uh the entities that are uh resident in the countries but is it avoiding tax in anymore it doesn&amp;#39;t avoid tax because the tax is paid in for example the examples all I gave the taxes are paid in Canada yes okay next question ma hi Mr Carney McKenzie G with global news uh just on your personal assets do you have any um in stripe in Brookfield do you have any Equity stock options or anticipate any future payments from either two of those companies so the um first thing to say on with respect to my personal assets is I have complied with all of the rules in fact I&amp;#39;ve over complied with all of the rules uh in advance um so months and months and months in advance um and uh put in place uh both divestures so I actually don&amp;#39;t own uh directly any stocks uh in those companies but what I since I had worked at those companies I put in place ethical screens so my approach to uh public life and I&amp;#39;ve been in public life for uh more than two decades um is to meet all the standards uh and surpass the standards with the highest integrity and my record you can look at it my track record is that as governor of the Bank of Canada uh another roles uh internationally so I comply with the rules uh Pier pev has had 927 days to get his security clearance and still hasn&amp;#39;t bothered to do that um and I think the you know it shows a fundamental difference in approach I more than comply I more than comply in advance he never [Music] complies Brookfield [Music] [Music] uh the secur so I understand you might not own any stock directly right now but I&amp;#39;m talking about in the future so I just want to come back to this again I&amp;#39;m not going to own just to be clear sorry if I may just to be clear I own nothing now I came into public life at a time of Crisis uh I put my hand up uh because of the crisis because of what&amp;#39;s represented by that bridge what&amp;#39;s represented by the threats to uh these good uh men and women of unior and and and their colleagues across Southwestern Ontario and across Canada I came in what I&amp;#39;ve done is uh put all my Affairs in order well in advance I owe nothing I own nothing but cash and personal real estate so and I that&amp;#39;s not going to change um in public life that&amp;#39;s not going to change it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s actually quite straightforward so then just to just to be clear then going forward you have no potential Equity stake no potential stock offic or any other potential future payments that you currently anticipate could come from either strike or burfield so what I have is cash personal real estate and there assets that were all those assets were divested into a blind trust which is managed by a trustee and I don&amp;#39;t it literally means exactly what it says um I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s in it madame wait okay well uh [Music] extrem more respect gratitude natal po keep examp [Music] for example on a on a cabinet V person on [Music] a we example that in English please specifically about your regrets for making that mistake yesterday and whether or not it shows uh perhaps a shortcoming in terms of your language as well as understand understanding of Quebec issues well I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I very much regret uh that I misspoke yesterday I I uh you know the uh the horrors of the uh the December 6 uh Massacre of the poly Technic are very much still with us and the lessons are still uh to be fully learned in fact uh I just had a conversation this morning around related issues of conjugal uh conjugal violence I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m extending the the point but uh it&amp;#39;s there um it&amp;#39;s not a that was not a question of language that was a question of misspeaking uh and uh the uh to follow up on the previous question or to translate the previous question for you uh response uh look we have a very strong uh Quebec team I&amp;#39;m very proud We have six of our ministers and I won&amp;#39;t list them all uh senior Ministers of of a cabinet of 23 so more than a quarter Min uh of the very senior Quebec represent ation uh I have very strong ties into uh Quebec society as well it&amp;#39;s of course I&amp;#39;m not from Quebec not everyone is from Quebec you I&amp;#39;m come from Alberta born in the north uh and my French is uh is is fine but it&amp;#39;s not perfect um Mr car I&amp;#39;m Judy Trin with CTV News we have uh confirmed that Chandra Arya was disqualified because of foreign inter why that is a concern and the the Liberals have yet to pull out uh put up a full Ro roster of candidates in all 343 writings what is the possibility that foreign interference is impacting that selection of candidates either from India China Russia Iran let me uh let me go I&amp;#39;m going to deal quickly with the first part of your question if I may which is that um one of the things and I&amp;#39;ve had foreign I&amp;#39;ve had security clearance for uh almost two decades in various forms at various times uh one of the things about having security clearance is paev wouldn&amp;#39;t know because he doesn&amp;#39;t have a security clearance um and first point second uh with respect to the liberal candidates uh I&amp;#39;ll say two things one is we have a very robust and serious process of vetting candidates um and we take it very seriously and uh so there are some candidates that uh we don&amp;#39;t to use our terminology green light we don&amp;#39;t uh approve uh and that is the case uh with uh Mr Arya um we there is tremend tremendous interest uh in joining uh our candidate slate we have a remarkable slate of candidates I will just note uh the announcement yesterday of Shan Frasier coming in I could prone to uh Gregor Robertson uh Natalie Provo as I as we talked about earlier um uh Evan Solomon Tim hod like just a huge range of interest of people running for this team and it&amp;#39;s because of two things if I may help our country and I salute them for it and secondly because the Liberal Party uniquely sees that we&amp;#39;re all in this together so it&amp;#39;s a strong economy but it&amp;#39;s a strong social uh safety net um it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s good union jobs and reinforcing those jobs uh it is providing support for Canadians who can&amp;#39;t afford it so we don&amp;#39;t say as Mr paev said yesterday oh I guess Dental Care some people actually do use dental care so if you&amp;#39;ve got in under the window now you can keep it but everyone else it&amp;#39;s too late it&amp;#39;s too late oh and by the way if you you&amp;#39;re using Child Care forget about it um this is what&amp;#39;s bringing people to the Liberal Party um and we have an incredible group of candidates I&amp;#39;m very proud of them um and we will have a great team in government you&amp;#39;re in an area that back in 2022 was the sight of a weekl long blockade uh by people who were angry about the Trudeau government&amp;#39;s uh Co policies what do you say to those Canadians who lost trust in the liberal government back then and do not have trust in you now because of your affiliation with that party well look I um I&amp;#39;ve never I haven&amp;#39;t been a politician I became a politician two months ago a little more than two months ago two and a half months ago um and I came in because I knew this country needed big change uh we needed big change in the economy um we needed big change in how we supported people we needed big change to deal with with Trump um and I think you&amp;#39;ve seen uh that in the short time that uh my government has been in place that big change we canel the consumer carbon tax we uh got rid of the capital gains tax uh we uh put in place a series of protections for workers with respect to the Trump uh tariffs whereas uh Mr PV would just use all of that money that belongs to them belongs to them because they&amp;#39;re the ones who are being hit use them to uh cut taxes uh for others we extended uh dental care we negotiated new security Partnerships with our oldest Partners in France uh and the UK I could go on and on but uh Mr Chase is uh waiting part of how you rearn trust and I understand the frustration so those people understand the frustrations uh with respect to cost of living part of the way you earn trust is by action and what this government is all about is action Steve I&amp;#39;m sorry last question to Steve before hi Steve Chase uh from the glob I got one question and one followup the first question is about these issues that Mr paev raised yesterday he&amp;#39;s suggesting you&amp;#39;re beholden to China he talked about your regular visits to China you went there at the time when Z was trying to show the world that he&amp;#39;s open for business you went back in the fall then Brookfield secured a $276 million loan for some uh property there I guess that was underwater are was that a sweetheart loan are you beholden to China I&amp;#39;m absolutely not um uh first thing uh second second thing I&amp;#39;ll say look Mr POV doesn&amp;#39;t understand the world Mr PV is a lifelong politician it&amp;#39;s all he&amp;#39;s ever done the slogans SL sound bit slander doesn&amp;#39;t understand how the world Works China happens to be our second largest trading partner it&amp;#39;s our second largest trading partner um we have trade disputes with China right now um caused by them uh in the agriculture section is one of the areas which we need to engage on it&amp;#39;s one of the areas when you think about again uh the auto sector and the future of the auto sector we&amp;#39;ve got to understand where China is where China is going uh whether or not there&amp;#39;s any room for partnership uh in that look I&amp;#39;m beholden to absolutely no one except to the Canadian people I am here for the Canadian people Steve your followup yeah followup uh continue uh continue yes the uh Chinese Ambassador has given I think three or four interviews in the last few weeks talking about his interest in reopening free trade talks my question for you is as we try to diversify away from the United States uh and reduce our Reliance and our trade with the United States is it your belief that we should be increasing our trade with China look I and and reopening free trade talks here here&amp;#39;s um my view on on this broader set of issues we need to diversify our trade as a country we are over reliant on as wonderful as the trade going across that bridge we are over Reliant uh on the United States I think it&amp;#39;s a lesson we&amp;#39;ve all learned uh we need to diversify we want to diversify with like-minded Partners um that&amp;#39;s why I went to uh Europe uh in my first week first days as prime minister uh spoke first with European president V liion obviously met with the French President uh and then separately because it&amp;#39;s not part of Europe anymore as you know uh the United Kingdom uh in terms of building trade with them there are Partners in Asia that we can build deeper ties um there are certain activity that but the partners in Asia that share our values don&amp;#39;t include China uh there&amp;#39;s certain activity that we could have with China uh we obviously do have a large amount of trade with them but we have to be very careful very deliberate and they need to meet Canadian uh standards okay m soel [Music] show you know he&amp;#39;s a conspiracy theorist spends too much time with his magga friends and he comes up whatever he can think of I behold to the Canadian people I&amp;#39;m proud I&amp;#39;m proud to be working uh with my colleagues uh at a crucial time for our country and I&amp;#39;ll say one last thing we have a positive agenda for this country we are bringing Canadians together to build yes the auto sector is under threat but what today is about is building the future of the auto sector together that&amp;#39;s the positive agenda not coming up with slander of the day thank you very much quick questions from Loc oh I&amp;#39;m sorry good morning Rob hindy from am800 I&amp;#39;m guessing Eric and Chris and the union officials behind you have told you how these uh terrorist will impact Windsor essic so your message to uh Windsor essic uh the your supporters and undecided voters as well yeah so the message is clear we&amp;#39;re we are absolutely laser focused on this issue we are laser focused on the issue you have two great uh individuals behind you and direct lines of communication uh to me and the cabinet uh to make sure that we&amp;#39;re taking action so uh we have done several things uh in order to put in place the support that&amp;#39;s necessary uh I won&amp;#39;t go to all of them but a bunch of financing facilities for the companies that work here so that they can continue to operate well we&amp;#39;re negotiating a better deal for Canada that&amp;#39;s the first thing I mentioned the support for workers but what we&amp;#39;re also doing and I think this is crucial is we&amp;#39;re not waiting because one of the things we&amp;#39;re learning is that on the other side of the bridge they&amp;#39;re a little volatile they&amp;#39;re a little up and down a little bit on and off hot and cold uh with respect to the relationship so what we&amp;#39;re looking to do is build take control of our destiny build more here build more of the supply chain here in Canada create stronger ties more jobs uh for the future and that&amp;#39;s what the two billion dollars uh uh strategic fund that we&amp;#39;re announcing today and the links to a number of other programs this is going to go directly to companies to make in Investments to build Canada strong and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the message so it&amp;#39;s not about waiting uh until the Americans uh become more reasonable uh it&amp;#39;s about acting now and that&amp;#39;s a far better place to be uh take control of our destiny last question good morning Mark this is PR from TBC news wi sir are there any plans for the Liberal Party to put up a candidate in wi West uh absolutely absolutely we will have a great candidate uh look we have just on terms of candidates we&amp;#39;re in the in the last weeks of uh of candidate uh selection we as I said

that&amp;#39;s coming together uh to work for Canadians and that&amp;#39;s what Canadians expect we&amp;#39;re all coming together we&amp;#39;re stronger together and the liberal party is stronger for you thank you very much thank you this was s the press conference than
