## Transcript

picture this you work hard save for a couple years sign a mortgage and get a home it&amp;#39;s a dream a decent home on a safe Street in a beautiful community that was the Canadian promise for Generations but after 10 years of liberals that promise is broken housing costs have doubled Rising faster than in any other G7 country in 2015 when I was housing Minister it took only 39% of median household income to cover home ownership costs but after carne&amp;#39;s advice and Trudeau&amp;#39;s leadership that cost has risen to 60% before the Carney Trudeau liberals took power it used to take 25 years to pay off a mortgage now it takes 25 years to save up for a down payment in some cities in Vancouver you need to earn $243,000 just to qualify for a mortgage on an average home in Toronto that numbers nearly 223,000 and that is on top of saving up for the down payment itself nobody can afford this well almost nobody Carney just doesn&amp;#39;t understand that Canadians can no longer afford to live in towns and cities they grew up in so how did Carney Trudeau liberals let this happen first they gave billions of dollars to local government gatekeeping bureaucracies that block home building that&amp;#39;s why after 10 years of the Liberals Canada has the fewest homes per capita of any country in the G7 even though we have the most land to build on this is all due to local government costs and federal government interference for example in Ontario and BC government charges account for 30% of the cost of a new home which has actually increased since 2021 and the federal government takes a bigger share as well take the GST which adds $50,000 in costs to a home of $1 million meanwhile billions of dollars of liberal Housing Programs simply build bureaucracy and not homes you may have seen that I announced earlier that I would remove the GST on homes up to a million but after Trudeau and Carney pushed the Benchmark price in Vancouver up to 1.2 million and in Toronto up to 1.89 million there are now many places where a million dollars does not get you an average home anymore it&amp;#39;s almost hard to believe a million dollar used to be a castle today it&amp;#39;s not enough to get an average home in Canada&amp;#39;s biggest cities that&amp;#39;s why I am announcing that I will take the GST off of homes up to $1.3 million to make sure middleclass people who happen to live in Ultra expensive cities can get the savings as well this will save home buyers up to $65,000 on the purchase of an average home in a big city and it is equal to Savings of up to $3,000 in annual morgage payments I will fund this home buyer&amp;#39;s tax cut by eliminating $8 billion of liberal bureaucratic housing programs that have actually made homes more expensive the tax cut will spark 36,000 extra homes built each year generating more income for construction workers and businesses and bringing $ 2.52 billion of Revenue back to the government in income taxes paid by those entrepreneurs And Trades workers we will also incentivize municipalities to free up land speed up permits and cut development charges to build 15% more per year under my plan a young couple in Siri a single mom in ashaa a Tradesman in Regina will all be able to get on the housing ladder just like their parents did no more punishing the dream of home ownership we&amp;#39;ll build more tax less and get government out of the way most of all we&amp;#39;re going to bring home the promise of Canada where hard work gets you a great life in a beautiful house on a safe Street protected by Brave troops under a proud flag Canada first for a change let&amp;#39;s bring it home
