**Melissa Lantsman (@MelissaLantsman):** Brookfield won’t tell you if he still holds assets, and experts are calling him out on his “blind trust”.

Yesterday, Mark Carney told you his assets were in a “blind trust”. 

He told you that he no longer knew what he owned. 

He controlled those assets three days ago. 

That’s not how it works. 

He thinks you’re stupid or he’s lying. 
Or both. 

Canadians deserve to know who he’s working for.
