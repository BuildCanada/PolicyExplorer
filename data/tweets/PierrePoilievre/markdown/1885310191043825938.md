**Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre):** Two Predictions:

1. Any minute now, a Liberal journalist will report that Carbon Tax Carney will reverse himself and suspend the Liberal carbon tax until after the election and that he is repeating Trudeau’s 2015 broken promise to cut middle-class taxes.

2. Carbon Tax Carney would bring back an even bigger carbon tax if he ever won the election.
