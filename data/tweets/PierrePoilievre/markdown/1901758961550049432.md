BREAKING: Mark Carney says that having a carbon tax in Canada is a requirement to trade overseas. 

Nonsenseâ€”taxing our energy will simply punish our businesses and ship jobs abroad. 

Just like when Carney supported carbon taxes in Canada while his company invested in American, Australian and Chinese coal. 

Only Conservatives will axe the tax for everyone, for good, forever: https://t.co/eKrSgW05OB
