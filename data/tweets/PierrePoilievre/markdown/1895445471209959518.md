Dear Mark Carney, 

Three days ago, you denied any role in your companyâ€™s decision to move its headquarters from Canada to the U.S.

Documents prove you chaired the board meeting where the decision was unanimously approved.

Since then, you have vanished from sight.

Where are you hiding? 

When will you face the music?
