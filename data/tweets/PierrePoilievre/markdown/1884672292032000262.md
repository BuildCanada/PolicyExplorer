Canadians won't get fooled again.

After years of Liberals pushing for higher and higher carbon taxes, nobody believes Carbon Tax Carney's con job.

Here is what he would do:

2. If re-elected, he would bring in the biggest carbon tax everâ€”an idea he is on camera supporting countless times for many years.
