This week I visited another BC lumber mill SOLD OUT by Freeland when she BACKED DOWN to Trump and signed onto a trade deal that allowed unjust American softwood tariffs to stay and rise. 

Remember, Harper got the tariffs lifted. Liberals let the Americans slap them back on.

Ignore the grandstanding: Freeland/Trudeau are weak and they will back down to Trump again.
