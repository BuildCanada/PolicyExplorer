**Chief Billy Morin (@billymorinECN):** Carney is in Edmonton today; which is apart of 🇨🇦’s largest Hydrocarbon Processing Region with over $45Billion of investment, & 30,000 direct/indirect jobs that sustain local families in the region. 

He wants to kill their jobs by putting a cap on our Industry. 

It is time for new Leadership in 🇨🇦.

### Quoted in Retweet

**Chris Warkentin (@chriswarkentin):** No wonder Trump endorsed Carney! 

Carney says himself that oil needs to “stay in the ground” 

At a time when we need to protect Canadian energy jobs and get our resources to market, Carney announced today he will kill 54,000 jobs with his oil and gas emissions cap. https://t.co/aLM9Fq5ywa
