So this Liberal Minister says Carney was just putting his shareholders first when he moved his company HQ out of Canada to the U.S. 

That says two things: 
(1) Carney put money ahead of the country; 
(2) Carney believes that, after his last 5 years as Trudeauâ€™s economic advisor, the U.S. is a better place to do business than Canada. 

Both 1 and 2 are reasons he should not be Prime Minister.
