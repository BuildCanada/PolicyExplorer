A woman was released back into the community in Ajax in October after attacking people with a machete, and now sheâ€™s committed another heinous, violent attack. 

This weekend, she attacked and attempted to light a Muslim woman on fire.

Thanks to Liberal catch-and-release laws, hateful lunatics like these are terrorizing our communities every day.

Conservatives will bring jail, not bail, to keep them locked up and bring home safety to our streets.
