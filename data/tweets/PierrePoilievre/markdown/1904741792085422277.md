Thrilled to receive the endorsement of Nathan Bergstrand, UA Local 67's Business Manager, a great champion for his workers.

His members are the extraordinary Canadians who build our country.

Together we will make sure they, and all the workers across this country, have a Prime Minister and new government that will put Canada First â€”for a change.
