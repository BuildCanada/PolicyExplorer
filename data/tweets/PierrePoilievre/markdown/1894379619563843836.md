Where have the Liberals been for a month? 

Instead of internal leadership squabbling, hereâ€™s what they could have done to make our economy less vulnerable to the U.S.: 

- Repeal the no-new-pipelines law to get our energy to more markets 
- Axe the carbon tax to bring home lower prices
- Pass a bring it home tax cut to make ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ businesses more competitive 

Sign if that sounds like common sense to you: https://t.co/US1RijukVK
