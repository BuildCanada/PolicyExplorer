**Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre):** Carbon Tax Carney is the ultimate Liberal insider. 

He's the Chair of Trudeau’s Task Force on Economic Growth and advised the Liberal government for years before that.

And now he campaigns for the same Liberal policies that tax your work, double housing costs, and will hike the carbon tax to $0.61/L.
