Thanks to the great police unions of BC’s lower mainland for the chance to talk about my plan for the biggest crack down on crime in Canada’s history. 

Thank you police officers. Canadians love you.

My common sense laws will lock up criminals, ban drugs, secure borders, deport lawbreakers and respect lawful firearms owners.
