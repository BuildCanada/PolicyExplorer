**Dr. Leslyn Lewis (@LeslynLewis):** This is what a Leader looks like! The Liberals need to put their partisan interests aside, recall Parliament and pass @PierrePoilievre's Canada First Plan that will: 

- Put pressure on the US through targeted tariffs that maximize impact on American companies while minimizing impact on Canadians 

- Simultaneously lock arms with American economic interests that favour Canada. We need to marshal support among those workers and businesses that depend on trade with Canada 

- Rebuild our military and control our borders to regain the confidence of our partners, assert our sovereignty and protect our people 

We will stand up to protect our great country and unleash the power of our people and our potential. I am proud to stand with @PierrePoilievre  and this Canada First plan.
