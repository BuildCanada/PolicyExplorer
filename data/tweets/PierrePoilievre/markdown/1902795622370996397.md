Carneyâ€™s hand picked Liberal Environment Minister admits Carney would CAP Canadian energy production.

Just last week, the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report confirmed this Liberal cap would kill 54,400 full-time jobs & shrink Canada's economy by $21 BILLION every year by 2030.

Carney will continue the lost Liberal decade by blocking projects to keep Canada weak and reliant on the U.S.
