I am incredibly relieved to hear of the release of Romi, Doron and Emily, three young women who were cruelly held hostage by Hamas since October 7th, 2023.

The world cannot rest until every hostage, including the body of Canadian Judih Weinstein, is released and returned home to their families and loved ones.
