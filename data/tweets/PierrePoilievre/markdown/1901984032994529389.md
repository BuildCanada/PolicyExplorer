Prime Minister Carney said yesterday Canada cannot trade with the world unless we have a carbon tax. 

Yet he moved his company headquarters to New York and invested in U.S. coal, where there is no carbon tax. 

He wants Canadians to pay carbon taxes that he dodges paying himself.

If Carney wins, Canada loses: https://t.co/StFW0QL37Y

**Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre):** BREAKING: Mark Carney says that having a carbon tax in Canada is a requirement to trade overseas. 

Nonsenseâ€”taxing our energy will simply punish our businesses and ship jobs abroad. 

Just like when Carney supported carbon taxes in Canada while his company invested in American, Australian and Chinese coal. 

Only Conservatives will axe the tax for everyone, for good, forever: https://t.co/eKrSgW05OB
