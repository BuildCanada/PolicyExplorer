**Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer):** BREAKING!

Carney caught lying:

Carney tonight when asked about Brookfield moving to New York: "I was chair of Brookfield Asset Management. I ceased to be chair on the 15th, I think, of January when I announced for leadership... The decision, the formal decision of the board happened after I ceased to be on the board. I do not have a connection with Brookfield Asset Management."

The truth: This decision was made back on October 31st and reported on November 1 2024

Mark Carney got caught lying to Canadians again. 

As chair of Brookfield, Mark Carney chose to move jobs out of Canada into Trump's hometown. 

Trump wants our jobs and Mark Carney is just the man to help him.

If Carney wins, Canada loses.
