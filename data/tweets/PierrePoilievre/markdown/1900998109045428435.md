**Chris Warkentin (@chriswarkentin):** Why is Mark Carney working so hard to hide what he owns and how he got it? 

Yesterday he claimed his assets were in a “blind trust” he went on to claim that he no longer knew what he owned…..even though he controlled those assets until a few days ago. 

If he forgot all he owns in less than a week, he’s got real problems!

If he’s lying again, Canadians have real problems. 

Who’s Mark Carney really working for? You or himself?
