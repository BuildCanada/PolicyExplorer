Jack, you are a warrior for your workers.

Your LiUNA workers will be building many more homes that they will be able to afford to live in.

Together, let's put Canada, and our workers, first â€” for a change.

**LiUNA! Local 183 (@liuna183):** When the sales tax rebate was first introduced in 2010, the exemption applied to new homes up to $400,000 and the average cost of new homes in the GTA was $443,000 and applied to all new homebuyers.

Today, with new home prices averaging $1.15 million, the rebate has not kept pace with the cost of new home construction. Raising the threshold to $1.3 million on new homes is a necessary adjustment that will make homeownership more attainable for all new homebuyers.

This is a good policy proposal that will not only incentivize new homebuyers but also fuel new residential construction, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs for LiUNA Local 183 members.
