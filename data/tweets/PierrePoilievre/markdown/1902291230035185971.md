Last night, President Donald Trump endorsed Mark Carney.

Why? Because, as Trump said, he’s “easier” to deal with, and knows that I will be a tough negotiator and always put Canada First. Carney is weak and would cave to Trump’s demands, just like he did when he moved his company headquarters from Canada to New York City.

Canadians don’t want a weak and conflicted leader. They want a strong Prime Minister who will put Canada First.
