TAKE BACK CONTROL OF THE BORDER & SAVE ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ trade:

We must:

1. Send Canadian Forces troops, helicopters & surveillance to the border now
2. Add at least 2000 border agents & extend CBSA powers along the entire border, not just crossings
3. Install high-powered scanners, border surveillance towers & truck-mounted drone systems to spot border incursions
