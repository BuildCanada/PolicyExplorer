Mark Carney blatantly lied to Canadians last night.

He claimed he had nothing to do with moving his company headquarters to Trump's America, even though he chaired the meeting where the decision was made and wrote company shareholders endorsing the move.

If he won't protect jobs in his own company, why would he protect yours?

If Carney wins, Canada loses: https://t.co/StFW0QKviq
