Is it too much to ask the Prime Minister to disclose all assets he has in tax havens?

## Quoting Tweet

**Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre):** Mark Carney hid his corporate assets in Bermuda to dodge the taxes that Liberals force on Canadians. 

He will always favour tax-havensâ€”because his corporate assets are still hidden in one.

He never puts Canada First!
