**Larry Brock (@LarryBrockMP):** Now they suddenly care about spending? Let's talk about the real waste. 

The Liberal Government's record speaks for itself: $60 million on the ArriveScam, $100 million to McKinsey, and over $20 billion a year on high-priced consultants while growing the public service by 40%. The last economic update blew past the budget by 55%, and after 9 years, they've added more to the national debt than all previous governments combined. We now spend more on servicing that debt than on healthcare. 

Where was the concern about spending then?
