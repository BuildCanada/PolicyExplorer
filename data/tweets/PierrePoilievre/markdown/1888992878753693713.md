President Trump is wrong - we will never be a 51st state. Canada is and always will be a proud, sovereign, independent nation.

These latest American threats of tariffs on our steel and aluminum industry deserve a response from this government.

The Canadian people are strong. Our workers deserve a champion that will fight for them, instead of rolling over and surrendering our country's true strengths like the Carney-Trudeau Liberals have done for years.
