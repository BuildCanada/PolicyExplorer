**Toronto Police Association (@TPAca):** Congratulations to our members and the Integrated Gun & Gang Task Force, Public Safety Response Team and @TPS52Div Major Crime Unit on their outstanding work in Project Poppie. This investigation into the reckless gunfire and violence on Queen Street West, back in November, has led to 14 additional arrests, 105 charges, and the continued pursuit of those responsible for endangering our city.

TPA President @TPACampbell continues to highlight the importance of keeping repeat violent offenders in custody, as over half of those arrested were out on bail. We cannot wait indefinitely for change in Ottawa. We need a government that listens and takes action to protect our communities by fixing a broken bail system.

Thank you to our members for your tireless dedication to public safety.
