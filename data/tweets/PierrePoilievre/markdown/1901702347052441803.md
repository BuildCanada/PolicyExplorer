St. Patrick’s Day always reminds me of my grandfather, Patrick Farrell—the world's greatest Irishman.

A man of faith & family who now spends his days serenaded with the sweet sound of angels' hands on Celtic harps.

Tonight, I'll raise a glass and share a laugh in his honour.

Happy St. Patrick's Day, and cheers to you, Grandpa. 🍀
