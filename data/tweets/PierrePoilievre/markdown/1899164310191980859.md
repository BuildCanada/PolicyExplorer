Mark Carney's Chief of Staff is none other than Trudeau's ex-Public Safety/Immigration Minister, Marco Mendicino.

He's the guy forced to resign after he:
- Moved mass murderer & serial rapist Paul Bernardo out of a maximum security prison
- Allowed gun crimes to surge 116%
- Did nothing to stop Beijing's foreign interference in Canada's democracy
- Helped Trudeau break our immigration system

Nothing has changed. Do these guys really deserve a fourth term?
