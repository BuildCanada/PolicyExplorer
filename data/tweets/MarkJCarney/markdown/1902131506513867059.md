In Iqaluit, I met with @NTunngavik and @ITK_CanadaInuit to discuss our work ahead, including building more homes, energy projects, and infrastructure faster in the North.   
             
We can and will grow a stronger economy across the North — and we’ll do it in partnership with Indigenous Peoples.
