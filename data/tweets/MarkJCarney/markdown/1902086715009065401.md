Canada is an Arctic nation — and we can never take our Northern sovereignty and security for granted. That’s why meeting with Premier Akeeagok in Iqaluit was a priority for my first week in office.

Together, we’re going to build the economy across the region — with more homes, more port capacity, more energy projects, more jobs, more opportunity.

We also talked about the growing threats to our Arctic sovereignty. Premier Akeeagok and I agree: it’s time to accelerate defence spending and expand the Canadian Armed Forces’ Arctic presence to keep our North strong and free.
