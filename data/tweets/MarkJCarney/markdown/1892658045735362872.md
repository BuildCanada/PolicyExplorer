**Dominic LeBlanc (@DLeBlancNB):** Time and time again, @markjcarney has demonstrated he has what it takes to steer a G7 economy through choppy waters. He is the leader our party - and our country - needs. 

That’s why I’m supporting Mark Carney to be the next leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. https://t.co/OOwnfwfXe4
