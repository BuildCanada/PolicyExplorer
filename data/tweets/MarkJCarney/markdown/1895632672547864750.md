Thank you, Borys, for introducing me to your community.

The US, EU and Canada have been strongly supporting Ukraine in its fight for freedom. I am immensely proud of the military and humanitarian support Canada has provided, particularly that Canadians have welcomed over 300 000 Ukrainians in our country. 

Canada is Ukraineâ€™s steadfast ally. President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people have our admiration for their incredible courage. 

As Prime Minister, I will ensure Canada continues to remain steadfast with Ukraine in defence of freedom against Russian aggression.
