I fully support Chrystia Freeland and her campaign in light of this disturbing report. I am fully committed to defending the integrity of this race and stand firm against any attempts to undermine our democracy.

My deepest gratitude to the national security and intelligence officials who lead this important work to sustain trust in our democratic process.
