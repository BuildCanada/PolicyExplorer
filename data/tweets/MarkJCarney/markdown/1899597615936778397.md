It has been more than two days that the supply of electricity to Gaza has been shut off. It must resume — essentials including food, electricity, and medical supplies should never be used as political tools.

Canada must work with our allies to stand up for international law to promote sustainable peace and security in the Middle East and to support full access to humanitarian aid for Palestinian families.
 
As this work continues, both parties must work towards the return of all hostages and the completion of the ceasefire agreement.
