President Trumpâ€™s latest tariffs are an attack on Canadian workers, families, and businesses. My government will ensure our response has maximum impact in the US and minimal impact here in Canada, while supporting the workers impacted. 

My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade.
