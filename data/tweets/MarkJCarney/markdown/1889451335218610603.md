President Trump seems to think he can suspend the laws of the United States, of international trade, and of economics.

The American Congress and US courts will decide for themselves how they will address these violations of Presidential powers.

President Trump’s actions will hurt millions of Americans workers and all American consumers. And after promising to reduce inflation, his actions will send it and interest rates up.

In Canada, we understand the laws of economics. That’s why we will be masters of our own house in building the strongest economy in the G7.
