It was a pleasure seeing President @EmmanuelMacron today. With his leadership, France is attracting unprecedented levels of foreign investment while accelerating the transition to net zero. 

 Looking forward to more work together to create good jobs and build clean prosperity. https://t.co/rgc8kP2bIH
