Elbows up, Canada.

Donald Trump’s about to learn that Canada’s got nerves of steel.

Canadian steel and aluminum is the best in the world — let’s get building the bridges, ships, hospitals and homes we need, and do it with 100% Canadian steel and aluminum. 

Let’s keep steel and aluminum workers on the job. 

If we stand together, we will win.
