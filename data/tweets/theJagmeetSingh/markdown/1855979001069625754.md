Today, we remember and honour the brave men and women who have given so much to protect our country, peace and freedom. Their dedicated service and sacrifice has made Canada the incredible country that it is today.

Canada has a long history of defending peace and safety around the world, and that’s because of the strength and resolve of Canadian Armed Forces members and the loved ones who support them.

I’m proud to wear a poppy as a constant reminder of the sacrifice of brave Canadians who lost their lives in combat, a selfless act to secure a peaceful future for their loved ones, all Canadians, and people around the world. It also reminds me that there’s still a lot of work to do to make sure that Canada’s veterans get the respect and dignity they deserve. 

For me, respecting veterans includes ensuring they have the trauma-informed care, health care, mental health care, pensions and supportive services they deserve, as soon as they need them.

This Remembrance Day, New Democrats ask all Canadians to take a moment to reflect on the sacrifices made by Canadian veterans and current members of the Canadian Armed Forces.

Lest we forget.
