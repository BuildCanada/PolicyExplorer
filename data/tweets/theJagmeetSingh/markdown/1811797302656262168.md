Liberals and Conservatives rewrote the rules, helped corporate grocery chains make record profits and gave them billions more in corporate welfare.

Now, 1 in 5 Canadians are skipping meals.

Today in Winnipeg I'll be outlining my plan to lower food prices.

New Democrats will change the rules - protect you from corporate greed, slice grocery prices with price caps and put an end to corporate handouts.
