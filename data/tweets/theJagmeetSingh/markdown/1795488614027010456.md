Today, my friend MPP @solmamakwa made history in Queen's Park - when he spoke his Indigenous language Oji-Cree in the legislature.

This was a historic moment that touched thousands across the country.

For years, I've watched Sol advocate for the rights of Indigenous communities across Ontario and Canada.

And I was very proud to watch him deliver his speech today alongside @LoriIdlout and our team.
