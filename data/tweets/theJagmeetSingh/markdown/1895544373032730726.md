Zelenskyy is what courage looks like in these times.
 
This is what it is to resist Donald Trump. 

He has no place as part of the next G7 meeting in Canada. 

I am calling on the leaders of all political parties to clearly send this message to Donald Trump. 

I would rather stand with President Zelenskyy any day, than invite Donald Trump to our country.
