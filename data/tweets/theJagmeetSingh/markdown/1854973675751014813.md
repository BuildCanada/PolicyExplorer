I strongly condemn the violence that happened in Amsterdam yesterday. All perpetrators need to be held accountable.

Nobody, nobody should be subjected to violence or discrimination on the basis of their nationality, religion, ethnicity or their belief.

Violence is wrong. Yelling anti-Arab chants is wrong.

Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and Anti-Palestinian racism must be fought.

We canâ€™t let hate win. We all have a lot of work to do to build a safer world.
