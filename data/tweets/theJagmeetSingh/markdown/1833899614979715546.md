Today we remember all those who lost their lives to the vile terrorist attack of 9/11. 

And we honour the heroes who acted selflessly on that day, including first responders. 

Americans and members of the global community that offered their help and solidarity showed us that love is stronger than hate.

Let us remember this as we strive for a world without terror.
