Trump's threats are an attempt at economic bullying.

I've dealt with bullies all my life. 

And, the way to deal with them is to show strength.

I've called for Canada to establish a jobs war room, to protect Canadian workers and families â€” Justin Trudeau must take this threat seriously.

Protecting good, Canadian jobs has to be the priority.
