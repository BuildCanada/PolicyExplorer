Today on Flag Day, we celebrate the Maple Leafâ€”our symbol of unity, hope, and the country we call home. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

Canada is a place where we take care of one another. That's just who we are.

My parents came to Canada before I was born. My mom wanted a better life for her children. She worked hard to build that life for us. My dad studied and worked so he could serve Canadians as a doctor. 

I love this country deeply - and I tell my daughters the story of how their grandparents chose this country. They chose Canada for its compassion. Its commitment to fairness. And for our belief that we all deserve a good life. 
 
On this National Flag Day - Letâ€™s all remember why Canada is worth fighting for. 

And commit to standing up for this country.
