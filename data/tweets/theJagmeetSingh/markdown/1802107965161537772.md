On behalf of all New Democrats, I'm sending warm wishes to Muslims around the world as you celebrate Eid al-Adha with loved ones!

For many, this Eid is a difficult time as a humanitarian crisis continues to unfold in Gaza and Sudan.

Muslim communities will show tremendous generosity to help those in need and gather in prayer hoping for a brighter, peaceful and more just future. 

I join you in that hope. Eid Mubarak!
