New Democrats fought for a national Pharmacare plan and Dental Care Plan - and we got them done.

The Liberals have the legislation and the funding needed to keep their promises on dental care and pharmacare. 

They’re late opening dental care to adults 18-65. 

They’re dragging their feet on signing agreements with provinces to provide free birth control and diabetes medications. 

We Canadians are better off when we look out for one another.
