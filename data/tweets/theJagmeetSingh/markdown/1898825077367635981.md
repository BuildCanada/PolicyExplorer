British Columbia has signed on to the NDP Pharmacare Plan!

✅ Free Diabetes Medication and Devices

✅ Free Birth Control

✅ Free Hormone Replacement Therapy

A huge shoutout to Premier David Eby and the BCNDP government for signing a deal with Ottawa.

B.C. has paved the way with its own Pharmacare Plan - now more Canadians will get the care they deserve.

$1.5 billion is sitting there ready to go — people shouldn't have to keep shelling out their own cash until 2026.
