Last night, @LoriIdlout held an emergency debate on the police killings of Indigenous people.

Over 11 days - we've witnessed 6 killings after encounters with the police.

Indigenous peoples have offered solutions. 
We can't ignore them.

It will only deepen the systemic racism in our country.

New Democrats are calling for these systemic failures to be addressed immediately.
