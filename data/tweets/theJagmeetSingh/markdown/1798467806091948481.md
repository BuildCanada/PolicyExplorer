Every single Conservative MP, including Pierre Poilievre, voted against lowering your grocery prices.

They voted against price caps on essential foods.

They voted against ending corporate handouts to Grocery Giants.

They were supported by Liberals.

Now you know where Liberals and Conservatives stand - it's not with you.
