Great music! Even better company!

I stopped by the Winnipeg Folk Fest where I met some incredible people.

This is the Canada we can fight for and build, together.

More joy, and less worry for you and your loved ones.

A huge shoutout to the performers, volunteers &amp; organizers! https://t.co/FV0QDzGRCl
