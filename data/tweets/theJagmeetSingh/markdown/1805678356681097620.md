Corporate greed in our country has reached a breaking point after decades of Liberal and Conservative governments that have rewritten the rules to favour the ultra-rich.

Now, every bill you pay makes CEOs richer.

It's wrong.

I'll change the rules to help you, not CEO profits. https://t.co/425jGrbLc4
