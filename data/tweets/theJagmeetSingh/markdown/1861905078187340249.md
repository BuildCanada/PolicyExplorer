BREAKING

Tomorrow night, a GST/HST holiday will be passed.

Pierre Poilievre hates it - but New Democrats won’t let him win the fight.

This is just a start. If we form an NDP government, we will permanently take the tax off daily essentials and monthly bills.

That includes internet, cellphone, and home heating bills.

We also support a $250 rebate cheque — and we’re demanding Justin Trudeau include seniors, people with disabilities and injured workers.
