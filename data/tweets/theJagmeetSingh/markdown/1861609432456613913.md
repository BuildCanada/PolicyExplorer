Congratulations @ChenderClaudia & @NSNDP for a well-fought campaign.

As the official opposition - I know the NDP will continue to be a champion for working people in Nova Scotia.

Across the country, New Democrats are standing strong against Conservative cuts and fighting for a better future for all Canadians. Let's keep fighting for Nova Scotians together.
