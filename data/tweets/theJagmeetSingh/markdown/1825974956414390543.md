Congratulations to @UniteHere40 workers!

After over a year of fighting together, you’ve earned a huge win for each other, and for workers across the country who are standing up to corporate greed.

I was proud to march alongside you in your fight for a living wage.

Today and every day - I stand with workers.

Let's keep it going!

**Unite Here Local 40 (@UniteHere40):** Thank you @thejagmeetsingh and Richmond MLAs @henryyaomla @AmanSinghndp for marching alongside Sheraton YVR workers in their fight for living wages. You helped put the spotlight on hospitality workers’ need for living wages in our city. 

When we fight, we win!
