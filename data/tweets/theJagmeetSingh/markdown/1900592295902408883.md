Happy Sikh New Year to the entire Panth!

Today marks the first day of Chet, the first month of the Nanakshahi calendar!

In Canada and around the world, Sikhs are celebrating the 557th year of a revolution founded on love and justice.

May your year be filled with love and spirits remain in Chardi Kala.
