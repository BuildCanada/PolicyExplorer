Thank you Halifax! ðŸ§¡

Together, let's fight for a Canada where everyone can have a good job, a roof over their heads, and a fridge full of groceries.

A Canada where we take care of one another.

Every election, we're told the only choice is between two parties who let us down.

We donâ€™t need another government working for the billionaires. Itâ€™s time to put working people in charge.
