Education workers who help our children every day deserve our thanks, respect and fair wages.

This week I joined @cupenat Education Workers on picket lines in Edmonton.

They're demanding better for their schools and all kids.

One job should be enough! You should not need 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet!

It's time for Danielle Smith's UCP Government to step up.

Solidarity forever!
