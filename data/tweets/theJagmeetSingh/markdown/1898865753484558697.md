I want to congratulate Mark Carney on becoming leader of the Liberal party.

Canadians are counting on their political leaders to fight for them in these challenging times.

To stand up for a Canada where we take care of each other.

We will disagree on many ideas, priorities and policies â€” but we should always stand united in protecting our country from the threat posed by Donald Trump.
