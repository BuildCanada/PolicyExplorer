Pierre Poilievreâ€™s Chief Advisor is lobbying for real estate investment firms.

His governing council is stacked with real estate lobbyists.

Do you think you can trust them to fix the housing crisis?

The answer is no.

Pierre Poilievre can't solve the housing crisis.

When his inner circle is full of lobbyists that profit off of it.
