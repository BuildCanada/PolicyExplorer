**Heather McPherson (@HMcPhersonMP):** We are witnessing an alarming escalation in the West Bank.

The Govâ€™t of ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ must condemn ethnic cleansing &amp; attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank. 

Canada must recognize the State of Palestine now. 

Peace will only come with an end to the occupation &amp; a two-state solution.
