You deserve a break. Not millionaires.

An NDP government will take the GST off essentials permanently.

Home heating. Phone and Internet Bills. Diapers. Grab-and-go meals.

We will also take on corporate greed directly by capping the price of grocery essentials.

It's time for a government that's in it for you.
