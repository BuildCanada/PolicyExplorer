Canadians are worried about their jobs, and worried that Trumpâ€™s tariffs could drive up prices.

Here's what I told Trudeau we need: 

- A Jobs War Room set up to defend Canadians. I want unions at that table, designing a plan to fight like hell.

- The Conservatives fired 1,100 border officers. I want thousands of officers re-hired and recruited, and I want the CBSA to patrol the whole border.
