February is Black History Month, a time to honour the achievements and stories of Black Canadians who have fought to make Canada a better country.

It's an opportunity for all Canadians to learn, to recognize that Black history is Canadian history.

And, to commit to concrete actions to tear down systemic anti-Black racism.
