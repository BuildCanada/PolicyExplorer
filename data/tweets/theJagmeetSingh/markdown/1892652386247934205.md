If you oppose callous Conservative cuts.

If you oppose the rich getting richer while everyone else falls further behind.

Stand with New Democrats.

We fought for Dental Care, Free Diabetes Medications, and Birth Control and got it done.

We're taking on Corporate Greed in the grocery aisles, and we won't back down.
