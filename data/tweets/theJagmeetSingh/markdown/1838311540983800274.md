CEOs who set grocery prices should never be allowed to set health care prices.

But that’s the path Conservatives across the country have put us on.

Today, the NDP filed a motion to bring CEOs of for-profit health care operations (like Loblaws) to testify. 
 
We’re going to stop Pierre Poilievre and Conservative premiers from poaching doctors and nurses from our hospitals, then telling Canadians to pay up, or go to the back of the line.
