Today is the National Day of Action for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.

We must never forget those who were stolen from their families.

New Democrats stand with advocates fighting for #MMIWG Justice and for a Red Dress Alert to save lives.

On this day, I send strength and solidarity to survivors, families, and communitiesâ€”and vow to never stop fighting.
