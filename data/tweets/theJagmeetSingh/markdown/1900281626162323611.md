Today, our NDP Caucus met with @ILWUCanada  President Rob Ashton, where we reiterated our commitment to saving jobs and protecting workers!

When @ILWUCanada workers were on strike - New Democrats showed up at picket lines in support.

We will always stand with workers fighting for their rights.

Big Bosses will always choose profits.
New Democrats will always choose workers.
