President Jimmy Carter was a Nobel Peace Prize winner, peacemaker, lifelong humanitarian and a tireless worker for Habitat for Humanity. He earned respect and admiration around the Globe for being a man whose actions matched his values. 

Our thoughts and condolences are with his family, his loved ones and all Americans.
