Absolutely horrifying.

In just a few hours, over 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes - breaking the ceasefire agreement.

The Trump administration signed off on this attack - escalating violence in the region.

Canada must advocate for peace and step up to stop the loss of innocent lives.

Everyone in the region deserves peace and justice.
