Nothing beats Toronto during Caribana!
 
I absolutely fell in love with Soca when I was in University - and from then on I was hooked.

Unity. Gratitude. Celebration. 

These themes make up Soca in a way that you just can't help but stop and dance amongst friends.

Caribana is truly a gift - from the Carribbean community to Toronto and Canada where everyone is made to feel welcome.

Until next year! ü§ôüèΩ
