It's been 13 years since Jack left us.

In tough times, when some seek to divide us by where we were born or who we love, Jack taught us to respond with love, hope, and optimism.

He would have been proud of what we've accomplished:

Pharmacare. Dental Care. Support for workers.

And no matter how low our opponents go, we're focused on getting results for Canadians.
