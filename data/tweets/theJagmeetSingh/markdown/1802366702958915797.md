Happy Father’s Day!

My dad’s story is an inspiration, a rollercoaster of highs and lows.

He taught me to dare and reach for the sky.

In a village in Punjab, he dreamed of becoming a doctor and living abroad — and he did it.

He also taught me generosity — by always showing genuine joy in sharing whatever he has.

Sending love to all the dads out there today.
