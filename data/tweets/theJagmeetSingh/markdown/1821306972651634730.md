We've taken our people-powered movement to the Northwest Territories!

I stopped by a Farmer's Market in the area with our candidate, Kelvin Kotchilea to support local businesses and grocers and take on corporate greed.

Thank you to everyone I met - I won't stop fighting for you, the North and your loved ones.
