Canadian workers first - always.

Their jobs are on the line right now. They need to know we’ll make sure they can keep putting food on the table. 

So we need to fight like hell to protect Canadian jobs from Trump — workers shouldn’t pay the price if Trump starts a trade war.

I'm proud to stand with the @CanadianLabour , @SteelworkersCA  and Sault workers to lay out our Build Canadian, Buy Canadian Plan — and to talk about the need for a powerful package of supports for any worker hurt by Trump’s tariffs.

Our plan keeps more work in Canada, creates more good jobs in Canada, and champions unionized workplaces.
