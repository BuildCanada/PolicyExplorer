This week, the Liberals showed who they stand with - and it's not you.

Instead of increasing penalties for huge corporations that rip you off,
Instead of stopping mergers that give you fewer choices and drive up prices,

Justin Trudeau defended CEO profits over Canadians struggling with high costs.

His team voted against my bill to lower prices - at a time when 1 in 4 Canadians are living at poverty levels.

This is how they're choosing to end this session.
