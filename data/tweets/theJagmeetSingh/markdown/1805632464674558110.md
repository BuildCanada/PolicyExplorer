I had a blast at the Happy Days on Henderson Festival in Elmwood this weekend with our candidate @VoteLeilaDance!

The incredible energy and the amazing people made this experience so special.

I even had the chance to take a photo with the Power Rangers!

Thank you to the volunteers and organizers.
