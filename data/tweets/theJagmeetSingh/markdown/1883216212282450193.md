## Quoting Tweet

**Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders):** Better health coverage?

If Canadians became U.S. citizens they would lose their free health care, pay nearly three times more for their prescription drugs, and many of them wouldn’t be able to get coverage at all.

Something tells me they won’t be interested.
