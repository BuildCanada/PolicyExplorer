I'm very saddened to hear about the passing of His Highness the Aga Khan.

Today is a very hard day for Ismaili Muslims - including in my riding of Burnaby South, home to a large Ismaili community.

His Highness the Aga Khan leaves behind an immense legacy of kindness, generosity, and humanitarianism.

I send my deepest condolences to his family and Ismaili Muslims in Canada and around the word.
