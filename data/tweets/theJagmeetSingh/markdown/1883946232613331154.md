On International Holocaust Remembrance Day we remember the 6 million Jewish lives lost in the Holocaust.

80 years after Auschwitz's liberation, the pain of this heinous genocide continues to echo through generations, including in Canada.

Today, and every day, we must continue to fight against rising antisemitism.
