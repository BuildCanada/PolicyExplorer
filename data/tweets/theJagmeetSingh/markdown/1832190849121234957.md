I'm heartbroken to learn of Grand Chief Cathy Merrick's sudden passing. 

As a fierce advocate for First Nations people and as the first female grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, she changed lives and inspired generations.

Her legacy of fighting for justice and equity will live on. 

Iâ€™m sending my deepest condolences to her loved ones and all members of the Pimicikamak Cree Nation and the First Nations of Manitoba.
