Trump's proposed tariffs will hurt Canadian workers. But I won't stop fighting to protect jobs in this country.

Today and every day I stand with @CanadianLabour which represents over 3 million workers throughout Canada.

This is my promise: 

The NDP will always have the backs of workers.

They deserve better and they deserve action.
