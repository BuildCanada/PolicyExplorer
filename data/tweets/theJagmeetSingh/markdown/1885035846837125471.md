New Democrats send love and strength to all who lost loved ones in the tragic plane and helicopter crash at Reagan National Airport.

The news is heartbreaking.

We share the horror and sorrow people are feeling, thinking about the lives and futures lost, and the devastation their families and loved ones feel.

We also extend our thanks to first responders who do all they can to help in such difficult moments.

Our hearts are with families, loved ones and first responders.
