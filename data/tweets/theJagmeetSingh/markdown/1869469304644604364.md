I condemn this vile antisemitic attack on Montreal's Jewish community.

Synagogue is a place of prayer, peace and community. No place of worship should ever be the target of violence and hate.

I am thankful that no one is hurt. 

The perpetrators must be brought to justice.

My heart goes out to the Jewish community. I stand with you.
