It was truly an honour for @LeahGazan and me to meet Léa Clermont-Dion and discuss her latest film, “La peur au ventre,” an insightful documentary on abortion rights in Canada.

We're going to the fight to Parliament - because even though the right to choose exists, it remains inaccessible for too many people. 

This is something Léa explains in her film.

Faced with the rise of anti-choice groups, New Democrats are calling on the government to strengthen and protect abortion rights to guarantee access for all, no matter where they live.
