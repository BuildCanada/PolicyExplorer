Canadians take care of our neighbours. Itâ€™s just who we are. 

Taking better care of each other means more relief for you instead of more handouts to the richest corporations.

I've written to the provincial premiers: an NDP government will scrap the federal tax on daily essentials and monthly bills, and I've asked them to step up and scrap the provincial portion, too.

People need relief and they need it now.
