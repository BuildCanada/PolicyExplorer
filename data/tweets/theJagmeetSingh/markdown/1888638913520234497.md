I've had to fight my whole life.

I fought bullies in the playground.

The system as a lawyer.

Big insurance companies as an MPP.

As leader of the NDP - I fought to get dental care, free diabetes medicine and birth control for you.

Now, I'm ready to fight Callous Conservative Cuts and their Billionaire backers.

Because, I believe we are stronger when we lift each other up not tear each other down.
