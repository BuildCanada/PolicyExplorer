I'm honoured to have taken part in the Comox Valley Pride Parade!

This movement is rooted in love.

We're not going to let anyone divide us based on gender or who you love.  We’re not going to let anyone take us backward. 🏳️‍🌈

That's my promise to you.

To members of 2SLGBTQI+ community - New Democrats see you. We will always stand with you.
