Today, New Democrats will vote for a permanent GST Tax Cut on Essentials.

What will Conservatives and Liberals do?

## Quoting Tweet

**Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh):** A Permanent GST Tax cut on Essentials means: 
 
- NO GST on Home Heating 
- NO GST on Internet Bills 
- NO GST on Cellphone Bills 
- NO GST on Diapers 

And, a lot more money in your pocket.  
 
Weâ€™re forcing a vote on it this Monday in Parliament.
