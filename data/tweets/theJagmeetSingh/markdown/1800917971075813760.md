I strongly condemn this disturbing act of anti-Palestinian racism and violence.

Police have found that the family in London whose home was attacked had been subjected to repeated harassment and targeting.

My heart goes out to the family during this difficult time and all those impacted.

Anti-Palestinian racism has no place in our communities and must be confronted.
