Elmwood—Transcona! Don't wait until election day – you can vote early.

Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives will make cuts to health care, dental care, pensions, and EI for people.

But, if we stand together, we can stop them and we can win.

Every vote is going to matter. 

Advance polls are open now until Monday at 9 pm.
