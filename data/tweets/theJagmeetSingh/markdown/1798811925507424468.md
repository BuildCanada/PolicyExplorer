Today, we let all our veterans know how grateful we are for their service.

Nearly 15,000 Canadians took part in the Normandy landings to free Europe from the grips of the Nazi regime.

80 years later, we still look to the courage displayed during this moment as an example of valor.

We will never forget those who made the ultimate sacrifice.
