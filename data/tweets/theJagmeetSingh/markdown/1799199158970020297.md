Congratulations to @LoriIdlout for being named by iPolitics the Best Constituency Representative MP—recognized by her peers for her hard work!

From securing major investments toward Indigenous housing to advocating for justice for Inuit across the country—Lori has been integral in bringing the concerns of Nunavut to Ottawa.
