When my parent's came to this country - it was the kindness of others that helped them along the way.

My dad studied and worked so he could serve Canadians as a doctor.

He studied on a dirt floor in Punjab and became the Head of Psychiatry in a Canadian hospital.

Work hard and a live a good life - was the promise of Canada. A promise that New Democrats will restore.
