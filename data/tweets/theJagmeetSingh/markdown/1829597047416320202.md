It's almost unbelievable...

Conservatives in Alberta are turning over public health care to private company "Covenant Health," an anti-choice religious institution that will deny emergency contraception and abortions.

This will take us back decades - putting lives at risk.

Conservatives will never stop trying to control women's bodies and block reproductive rights.

Together, we must fight back.
