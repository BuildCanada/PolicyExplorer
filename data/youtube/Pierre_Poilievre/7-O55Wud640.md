## Transcript

wow wow wow thank you good evening what a pleasure to be here with all of you Canada here we are in this crucial time this is the time where we must decide whether we're going to choose a government that has put us in a very vulnerable economical position in the face of the threats of Donald Trump for a fourth term or are we going to choose change to put Canada first what an amazing crowd you know this journey began about 3 years ago for our family and we've been United ever since my family my husband when he announced that he was running for the leader of the conservative party he's been traveling from coast to coast to coast ever since so that he can be on the ground with the people because what we need is a government and a leader that's going to be for the people and by the people leadership is born from true love for our country from true patriotis it is not born from The Boardroom of the elite it is not born from fancy degrees and fancy titles the opposition looks down on my husband because he spent most of his life right here at home fighting for us all but that is not something the opposition should look down on they should not look down on our democracy and it's pretty ironic that Mr K is seeking public office but he looks down on that job so here we are my husband has put forward policies that's going to help all of us to make life more affordable policies to also help combat crime but although I love all of these policies I think what's important to also understand who is the man behind those policies why are we doing this my husband he was born from a teenage mother and he was put for adoption to two School teachers he's been working his entire life his family has worked so hard and they live paycheck to paycheck my family they immigrated here to Canada in 1995 we immigrated in the East End of Montreal my father he had to collect fruits and vegetables as his first job so that he can make ends meat at some point he had three jobs at minimum wage just so that he can make ends meat and feed our family by the age of 17 I left home and I was financially independent by the age of 19 I left Montreal in moved to Ottawa I took a student loan put myself through University I worked full-time and studied full-time just so that I can afford a roof above my head and food on the table while studying my husband and I have worked really really hard for everything that we got nothing was handed to us and my family came here for the Canadian promise and that was the promise that if you work hard you can get ahead so by the time that I was 25 and I was working in the Senate which is where I met my husband I yes I was 25 single woman at the time few months actually before I met Pierre and I had saved just enough money so that as a single woman I could afford a home in imagine that back in 2012 I was working for 50,000 a year saved $25,000 put a down payment on a little town house with two bedrooms that is the Canadian promise and that was 3 years before the liberal government took office but ladies and gentlemen hope is on the way because we are going to fight back to put Canada first with my husband and the next prime minister of Canada Pier paulm there something all wow look at that amazing he good to see you wow hello beautiful British Colombia who's ready to ask some taxes who's ready for homes you can actually afford who's ready to stop the crime who's ready to bring our jobs back home and who's ready to put Canada first for a change wow look at this crowd incredible I'm told there are as many as 5,000 people here today unbelievable as I was driving up I saw the people lined up in the rain have you ever had rain here before in British Columbia it's nothing you walk around in the rain for fun out here I love being back in this place beautiful British Columbia I I love you too I love you too I of course am an Alberton which is that alien species that invades your Province every summer for your lakes and your oceans and every winter for your ski hills we do spend a lot of money here but we love British Columbia's fellow westerners I got you know I I gained some of my best lessons from my parents on those road trips I I remember when I was a little boy we went camping in Pentium so we drove all the way road trip from Calgary we got there and we pitched our tent and I went to the shore and lo and behold there were these new things called jet skis I'd never seen them before but it looked thrilling so I ran back and I told my dad he had to rent me one of these things he went and checked he said it's a 100 bucks we're not paying 100 bucks for you to buzz around on the lake but we can rent you one of those little pedal boats you know the yellow things so he rents me this little pedal booat I go out into the middle of the lake the rich kids come over with their jet skis and start splashing me and laughing at me so I pedal my way back to the side of the shore and I I I went to my dad and te and told him the story and he said I'll make you a deal you can get back to Calgary and we'll get you some jobs here in there and you're going to save up some money by the time you turn 16 you'll have enough to borrow our minivan the Chevy Lumina you remember those things they look like a spaceship you can fill it up with gas you can drive back out to the campground you can rent yourself space and then you can pull the money out of your pocket that you earned and you can rent yourself a seedo for an hour how does that sound in other words very simple lesson if you want nice things in life you have to work for it right and sure enough I did and it worked and that was the Canadian promise that anyone from anywhere could achieve anything if they worked hard they could have a beautiful home on a safe Street protected by Brave troops under a proud proud Canadian flag that's why people come here look at sui one of the most wealth one of the most welcoming places in the world a place where Pioneers settled and over the years waves and waves of immigrants came here obviously throughout British Columbia we had the incredible seek loggers who came over to harvest the forest and then brought many of their family members to build inred ible businesses in places like sui and over the years people found this to be an incredible land of opportunity where they could do anything they wanted but that Canadian promise after the Lost liberal decade is broken everything costs more with the worst inflation in 40 years food prices have risen about 30 7% faster in Canada than they did in the United States in the exact same 5-year period housing cost of more than double it now takes about $1.2 million to buy a home in the an average home and the Greater Vancouver area in fact Vancouver Is Now by far the most expensive housing market in North America and the third most expensive anywhere in the world after liberals Pro promised they were going to make life more affordable and then crime chaos drugs and disorder overtake our once tranquil streets as criminals who are repeatedly released onto our neighborhood streets terrorize our citizens sell drugs to our kids and shatter what used to be beautiful and safe communities finally our economy has been weakened by years of radical Net Zero anti-development extremists led by Mark cardi and Steven Gilbo who have blocked our pipeline shuttered our minds attacked our forestry sector all while they move their money offshore to lower tax Havens or places with no environmental standards at all my friends our country life has never been more expensive our streets have never been more dangerous our economy has never been more vulnerable and we have never been so much under the American thumb as we are after The Lost liberal decade but the choice in this election is whether the Liberals deserve a fourth term or whether it is time whether it is time for a change to ax the taxes develop our resources put Canada first for a chain e now the Liberals are trying to pull a fast one on us they want to make us forget about the last 10 years all the damage that they've done and the weakness that they've created by replacing Justin Trudeau with his economic advisor and handp successor Mark Carney this despite it is it is the same liberal ministers the same liberal MP same liberal strategists same liberal promises they've been breaking for the last 10 years the only difference is that Mr Carney is a more weak out of touch and conflicted leader than even Justin Trudeau he's only done he has only done two things in Canada he's been out of Canada for most of his adult life up until recently he had three passports but since coming back he's done only two things he's been the economic advisor to Justin Trudeau helping him cause the economic damage and he's moved his headquarters out of Canada to the US while moving billions of dollars of investment from Canada to tax Havens where he doesn't have to pay his fair share but but my friends the good news is Canada was not like this before the Lost liberal decade and it won't be like this after they're gone we're going to P we're going to pass a big bring itome economic plan and it starts with cutting the taxes of the workers the investors the businesses the farmers the people who build our country we're going to it starts income tax I saw this incredible meme the other day it was a boy sitting in the park his his face buried in his hands crying his eyes out he had asked his dad what is an income tax form and his dad said well it's just like your high school report Court card except the inverse the harder you work the worse you do income tax is like the fine you pay for the crime of working hard no wonder people don't want to take that extra shift work that extra hour get that promotion or gain a bonus because if they do they're penalized through high levels of liberal income tax that has driven many of our best people out of the country for better opportunities we want this to be a country that rewards hard work and that's why I have announced that a Canada first government will cut income tax for the average worker by 15% but we also have to bring home our investment while greedy corporate insiders are able to move their money offshore and get rewarded for it by with lower taxes here in Canada you're punished with high taxes on investment it should be exactly the opposite we need more investment in Canada in fact we in Canada only get about $115,000 of investment for every worker in the country in the states it's 28,000 we only get 65% per capita investment compared to the rest of the developed world that means that our workers though they are the best in the world world don't get the tools and Technology to produce more and therefore bring more home we need to bring our investment back to Canada we also need to reverse the half trillion dollars of investment that is left for the United States over the Lost liberal decade as one of the steps towards doing that I announced today that a Canada that my government will bring in the Canada first tfsa topup now as you know the previous conservative government with the help of Mark straw and you were too young to be around at the time there uh staffer yes you were a staffer who else was there who was there you were there Carrie Lynn but that early my goodness Carrie Lynn Finley was there we brought in the taxfree savings accounts allowing you to save and grow your nest eggs tax-free now we're going to keep the existing tfsa the same as it is you'll keep being able to contribute $7,000 a year but on top of that our government will let you contribute an additional 5,000 as long as all of that extra money goes to Canadian companies so the this will I love it absolutely bring it home bring it home bring it home bring it home bring it home bring it home bring it well Mark Carney shs his money off to Bermuda to dodge taxes we're going to reward hardworking Canadians who set aside money by investing in Canadian companies that will use that money to buy Canadian equipment build Canadian factories Canadian mines Canadian pipelines and pay wages to Canadian workers and then we're going to axe the carbon tax remember the Liberals told us that if we got rid of the carbon tax the entire planet would be lit on fire remember that they said the carbon tax was the only way to stop forest fires that's funny I always thought you put fire out with water not with taxes they have senior ministers that are still in the cabinet who said they would resign in protest if ever the carbon tax were cancelled so what did Mark Cary do he didn't get rid of the carbon tax in fact the full carbon tax law is still on the books instead in a few days he's going to make it disappear from the pumps for the 30 days leading up to the election so that Canadians will forget that there is a carbon tax until they go and vote if if God forbid they get back in Carney will bring in a bigger meaner heavier carbon tax than ever before with no rebate but not only that he said that he wants a fatter industrial carbon tax on our steel mills our lumber Mills our cement and our fertilizer all of that will be passed on higher steel prices will drive up the cost of cars and make us more dependent on the Americans who won't have to pay the tax because they have none South of the Border imagine the one thing that Carney and Trump agree on is that they both want to tax Canadian industry Trump trump wants to hit us with tariffs Carney with a carbon tax the good news is it's not going to happen because as prime minister I will ask the tax for everyone for everybody for real for good for a change absolutely a ATT ATT ATT a attack attx set attack wow I think everybody wants ax the tax and then we're going to axe the inflation tax you know how inflation happens it's always the same thing government prints money to spend what it doesn't have that money goes out into the marketplace and bids up the cost of goods it doesn't make us richer to have more cash if there's not more stuff to buy with that cash if you have an economy with 10 apples and $10 it's a buck an apple now if you double the number of dollars to 20 but you still have only 10 apples it's not that you're twice as Rich it's just that each apple now costs twice as much that's inflation as Bank as the advisor to Justin Trudeau Mark Carney pushed more money printing he said we'd have deflation if we didn't print money God forbid prices go down right and so what happened our money supply went up from 1 .8 trillion to 2.5 trillion growing our money by 40% while the real economy grew by only 4% in otherwise in other words the money grew 10 times faster than the stuff that money buys and that inflated the price of everything now we have 2 million more people lined up at food banks we have 25% of our population in poverty we are going to stop the money printing which is actually the symptom the real disease is overspending we have to stop spending so much money on wasteful things in otta water my government we will cut back on the federal bureaucracy cut back on the Consultants that consume 2020 billion a year we we will come back on handouts stick horp insiders and we will cut back foreign aid to bring our money home to our people in this country in so doing we will pass a dollar Ford dooll law that requires we find equal amount of saving for every extra spending we do we'll run our finances the way you run your household by making tradeoffs and getting Bargains and getting better value for money so politicians can't just pass the bill on in more inflation debt and taxes they have to actually go into their departments dig out the waste get better value for money and lower the cost of government so that we don't destroy the value of the money that you earn every single day and the worst the worst inflation of all is housing inflation which is shut out for the first time time in Canadian history our youth cannot afford homes this has never been the case it now takes 29 years for a average bullet British Columbia family to save up for a down payment it used to be you paid off a mortgage in 25 years faster than it takes now for the down payment this is in part due to taxes and government inflation 60% of the cost of new home in Vancouver today is taxes bureaucracy delays Consultants zoning lawyers more money from a new home goes to bureaucrats in offices than goes to the Carpenters electricians and plumbers who actually build the homes so we are going to this is a shame and not only that the very Carpenters who build the homes cannot afford to live in them that is why we are going to cut back on the taxes and bureaucracy starting with my leadership and the team of our conservative party to eliminate the federal sales tax on homes under $1.3 million this will save a a home buyer as much as 65 Grand on a purchase or $3,000 a year in mortgage payments furthermore we will incentivize municipalities through Federal infrastructure money to speed up permits free up land and cut development charges to build 15% more homes per year and finally we will sell off 6,000 Federal buildings and thousands of Acres of federal land to build build build build build who's this come on up here come on this guy come on up here who this guy who's this guy good to see you up and say hello there we go what's your name Maxim what's that Maxim Maxim good to meet you so are you the sheriff around here hope do I have a parking ticket no I don't have a parking ticket you're keeping Law and Order around here have you caught any bad guys not yet he's looking out if there are any bad guys out there Max aim's coming to get you okay wait a to go are you ready look over that way are you ready to stop the crime way to go what a kid and and when you grow up do you want to own your own house do you think we should put Canada first excellent way to go buddy give him a round of applause everybody Maxim way to go my friend thanks very much for coming great all right he's my security is that proud mother over there that's great what a great kid you're raising he's going to be a cop one day yes good excellent we need more we love our police give it up for the police everybody way to go Max way to go and what's that jail yeah jail not bail for the criminal that's for sure but you know the choice in the next election on housing is taxes is whether the Liberals deserve a fourth term after driving up taxes and housing costs or or whether it's time to put Canada first with a new conservative government that will ax the taxes build the homes and bring home the dream of homeown ownership for every hardworking Canadian thank you and we're going to bring home our jobs we're going to bring home our jobs from around the world and that starts by repealing the anti-energy and resource laws in order to make it at home we will repeal the no new pipelines liberal law ceas 69 we will get rid of the energy cap that Carney has imposed on our oil and gas sector we will approve the ring of fire in Ontario to harvest the Strategic minerals we will give rapid approval through something called shovel ready zones where we'll go out we'll draw a circle around different land masses that are perfect for mines pipelines power stations or other things we'll give pre permitting so that companies don't even need to apply they only need to meet predefined specifications and standards and if they do they can get in get the shovels in the ground and get building from the start this will eliminate what's that what was that drill baby absolutely what do you do sir what do you do he drives a concrete stuff truck he wouldn't be able to give him a round of applause that's what we need boots not suits boots not suits boots not suits that's what we need the hard working people who build stuff are going to have a chance to do it you know we have such incredible blessings should be the richest country in the world right now have look at that you agree with that up there the richest country in the world we have the most uranium the most potassium potach we have the third biggest supply of oil the fifth biggest supplier of natural gas we have the most Oceanic Coastline of Any Nation on Earth we have we have the sixth biggest supply of lithium the list goes on and on and yet we're keeping it in the ground because of a radical Net Zero ideology that impoverishes our people while riching enriching the global Elites we have clean electricity that could power these data centers you know like Microsoft and meta and these other big companies alphabet they're all building their own nuclear power plants to feed these data centers these artificial intelligence centers they they it takes you know 10 times as much electricity when you do a chat GPT inquiry as when you do a Google search artificial intelligence we have that in the government too it's just a different type it's just a different type but it h we have the electricity in Canada to power these things what we need is to have shovel ready zones that pre-approve the power station and the data center the LG plant the pipeline the mines the factories we're going to reignite our great resource sector and bring home our jobs bring it home it it bring it home bring it home bring it home we're going to bring it home BR it BR it we're going to we're going to bring home our jobs and a brighter future for our people put our nation back in charge of its own future and our nation will be strong and able to stand up against President Trump or any future American president because we will be self-sufficient self-reliant and strong enough to stand on our own two feet obviously the choice in the election will be whether we reward the Liberals with a fourth term after they weakened our country and blocked our resources or whether it's time to put Canada first with a a conservative government that will unlock our resources and bring home our jobs but it will take boots and not suits if we're going to do it boots not suits do we have any trades people here today yes the trades God bless the trades I tell every young person the SE the key to success is to go into a trade I visited 600 different events last year almost all of them were medium-sized businesses and everywhere I go now these businesses they're not run by lawyers no no offense I know Carrie Lynn is a great lawyer how she she I'm very afraid to upset Carrie Lynn she's my whip she's she's a deadly woman but she keeps me in line and what what have you got there looks like you've got a stick or something don't hit me with that car Lyn oh you've got a great flag that's excellent excellent there we go Carrie Lynn Finley give it up for Carrie Lynn but these businesses they're not run by mbas they're run by trades people who took the skill set of solving problems and making things work and applied it to business and that's how they're generating so much value but unfortunately the governments want to give all their educational resources to White caller education I have no problem with University I was blessed to go myself but we should give fairness and we should give the Lion Share to the trades so that we can prepare the young people who will build stuff make stuff fix stuff move stuff and that's why my government my government our conservative government will put Canada first and put our trades people first by bringing back the $4,000 apprenticeship Grant and funding Union training halls for $350,000 young people trained to go into the trades and we want them to bring their paychecks home to safe neighborhoods so we will stop the crime the good news is do do you have any is there any crime in British Columbia at all wild isn't it the stories are crazy incredible how much crime is going on repeat violent offenders the good news is we don't have a lot of criminals the bad news is they're very productive or very destructive a tiny group of criminals are doing all of the crime in Vancouver the police had to arrest the same 40 offenders 6,000 times that means that each one of these guys was elected was arrested we have great police officer Jesse sahota here future conservative MP wrestling champion black belt in Jiu-Jitsu he even has the cauliflower ears to show it very powerful so very powerful guy who's going to fight for and he's mentoring our young people but Jesse I bet you have a lot of return customers out on the street right you're arresting the same guy over and over often times the the criminals say they're not even afraid to get caught they don't go through the trouble of avoiding the police cuz they know they'll be released before the paperwork on their latest arrest is even complete and then they go out and offend again and again if you're arrested every two days like those 40 offenders in Vancouver you got to be working at it all day every day it's hard work you know you got to be up at the crack of dawn to rob a bank and you know selling fentanyl by noon and carjacking by 2: in the afternoon and These Guys these guys don't even have uh unions they don't have benefits they they do get room and board they they go to prison for a few hours it's like the hotel California they check out but they never really leave but the reality it's crazy if you don't laugh you cry if you don't laugh you cry this is because of Bill c75 I quote that the judge is required to release the offender at the quote earliest opportunity under quote the least onerous conditions that is what we're going to get rid of I will repeal c75 it will be jail not fail jail not fail jail not fail then there's C5 house arrest which allows chronic car thieves to do their sentences in the comfort of their living room watching Netflix or playing Grand Theft Auto only to go out the front door and steal again we will repeal C5 and bring mandatory prison sentences for car thieves and other offenders and we will secure our borders we know that our weak borders with 99% of shipping containers going uninspected and the ability of criminals to walk straight across into our country is the responsible for almost all of the gun crime we have and the drugs that are coming into our country and that's why we're going to hire 2,000 more cbsa officers on the front lines by reducing an equal number of of back office bureaucrats and us using that money to put Frontline officers with powerful scanners that can look inside shipping containers watchtowers that can scan the Horizon of our border and stop people from coming in and we will pay for it by cancelling the multi-billion doll gun grab that targets law-abiding lawful trained and tested Firearms own this this gun grab which the police across the country oppose the police unions are nearly unanimous in imposing the gun grab they know that it goes exclusively after law-abiding people that that's a very simple truism that's easy to approve if you're a criminal you don't go out and get a possession and acquisition license right so taking the property away from the train tested proven and vetted licensed owner means that you're by definition going after the good guys and spending billions of police and law enforcement dollars doing it money that could be going to protecting our people liberals want to protect turkeys from Hunters I want to protect Canadians from criminals and then there's the drugs the drugs nowhere has been more ravaged by the fentanyl drug crisis than here in British Columbia it is a heartbreaking reality that we have lost 50,000 of our friends neighbors brothers and sisters to this mass murderer We call opioids we know that the crisis started when corrupt pharmaceutical companies targeted hospitals and Pharmacies with the lie that opioids were safe and non-lethal and non-addictive and they made massive sums even though later on email correspondents proved that they knew they were lying they even paid bonuses for the number of people that they caused to overdose the American government has even sued those companies and recovered $54 billion South of the Border yet here on this side of the border the radical liberal government not only fails to go after the drug companies and the mass criminals who perpetuate the crisis they use your tax dollars to fund the distribution of dangerous high-powered opioids more powerful than heroin opioids that get resold to our children and then the profits of which are used to buy even more dangerous fentanyl they decriminalize crack heroin cocaine and other hard drugs here in British Columbia and they do nothing to stop China from sending the ingredients that are ultimately used to make this deadly poison we also know that Mark Carney secured a $250 million loan for his company from the Chinese government he will never never stand up to Beijing when it comes to drugs and he should be ashamed of himself for saying that the fentanyl problem was not a crisis he should tell that to the 50,000 people who've lost their lives we know we have some loved ones there sorry I know I know sorry I know I know we hear stories like this all the time people who write me letters heartbreaking letters of good kids who grew up with great values but maybe got an injury and took a drug to try and relieve the pain or fell in with the wrong crowd and when they got addicted they never made it through but the good news is we can do something about it we're going to ban the drugs we're going to stop giving out tax funded opioids we're going to put the money we're going to put the money into treatment and Recovery Rehabilitation so that we can help the people who are addicted cleanse their bodies of these poisons through detox Counseling group therapy physical exercise yoga sweat lodges for First Nations transition into housing and a job the message that I have for anyone out there that might be suffering with addiction have hope hang on Hope is on the way thank you and we will recognize that the people who are mass marketing these drugs are killers if you sell 40 mgram of fentanyl you're selling enough to kill 20 people you might not know who you're killing but you're effectively firing bullets into a crowded room somebody is going to die and that is why we will treat Mass fentanyl producers and traffickers like murderers and mandate life sentences for every single one of them and we will help pay for all of the wonderful treatment we provide by suing the corrupt pharmaceutical companies that caused the problem in the first place speaking of big Pharma we will repeal the liberal law that seeks to tax and block you from using natural Health Products you should have the freedom to decide what you put in your body freed Freedom we're going to bring home the freedom to our country make this the freest country in the world but to have freedom you have to have a strong military we are going to rebuild Canada's Armed Forces to support our troops and our veterans that includes recruiting the soldiers to fill all of our allotment expanding our numbers in both the regular forces and the reserves we will put money into buying four powerful massive Arctic icebreakers so that we can take back control of our Arctic Waters from the Russians and the Chinese we'll go ahead with the purchase of submarines fighter jets and Poseidon aircraft that are able to surveil and interrupt foreign submarines that enter into our Waters we will double the size of the first parole patrol of the Great Canadian Rangers and we will build the first postc Cold War Arctic Base in Canada CFB a cawit we will expand the cadet Cadet program to get more of our young people before they even graduate from school enjoying mentorship from our soldiers and our Rangers learning outdoor skills and binding each other together from Nation to from coast to coast of our wonderful Nation we will be United in service and loyalty and we will prepare the Next Generation ation of Warriors that will defend our land we will also reject radical schemes like the liberal sensory cens Century initiative to bring our immigration system back under control liberals liberals want to  our population to a 100 million people in a very short period of time these these radical initiatives have undermined what was the best immigration system in the world we have brilliant immigrants and before the Liberals we had the best immigration system we want to welcome people who can get jobs and homes and who are able to contribute in numbers that our country is able to absorb and so we will ensure that population never grows faster than the housing stock than the number of jobs and the availability of healthcare we don't need any of these wild schemes that the globalist elites want to impose on us you know Mark Carney thinks he's better than everybody here he knows better that he and his friends at Davos can tell us all how to live our lives my friends we don't need any direction from him Canadians are smart enough to make their own decisions we will reject all all of his elitist schemes there will be no one in my cabinet allowed anywhere near the world economic forum we will bring home our Democratic control and put it in the hands of the people Mr Carney says he wants us to be European Mr Trump wants us to be American I want neither of those things I want us to be Canadian absolutely and to be a truly proud Nation we have to honor the history of those who came before us no more knocking down statues no more taking down our flag no more erasing Our Heroes when when you open the passport a year after a conservative government you're going to see Terry Fox our veterans the famous five and countless other Heroes we know we know that if we are able to see over the mountain it's because we stand on the on the shoulders of giants who came before us and passed on to us a wonderful country and a beautiful blessing not a perfect country with a perfect pass but a group of people who built an incredible land for which we should actually be grateful we should be grateful for everything we have in this country we are going to be we're going to be a self-reliant strong Nation with it which trades with itself which harvests its resources protects its vulnerable secures its borders honors its history rearms its military raises its flag and puts its country and its people before everything else bring it bring it it bring it homeing it it it we are not we are not a nation of tax collectors and toll masters of bureaucrats and busy bodies of Gatekeepers and Grandes of rulers and Rule makers no we are a nation of explorers and entrepreneurs of artists and Advent venturers of workers and Warriors of pioneers and Patriots we what binds us together is the Canadian promise the promise to you the single mother out there who's struggling to pay your bills that a better day is coming for you and your children the promise to the seniors that are choosing between eating and heating that help and hope are on the way the promise to the wonderful family that Lo lost a loved one to drug overdoses that their death will not be in vain that we will protect other people in the future that is the Canadian promise that is the hope we're going to be bringing home for all Canadians the Canadian promise that hard work gets you a great life in a beautiful home on a safe Street under a proud flag protected by brilliant soldiers to uphold that flag and its promise we must work together fight together and win together for our people for our land for our home for Canada first for a change let's bring it home thank you thank you guys thank you guys there's something tender about there's there's something all generations can have and hold
