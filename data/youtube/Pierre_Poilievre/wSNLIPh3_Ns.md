## Video Description

My message to President Trump:

The world needs our products and our expertise. If you, Mr. Trump, do not want them, the rest of the world does. 

If you choose to go down this road, you will lose the greatest trading partner and friend you ever had.

And within 4 years of a Canada First Conservative government, we will build a Canadian economic fortress that will allow us to be strong, self-reliant, stand on our own two feet, and stand up to the Americans.

That is what it means to put Canada First, for a change.
