## Transcript

I was asking the gentleman who's who's a very informed journalist whether he knows what Mark carne's Investments are and he said no that's not his fault that's Mr carne's fault I just point out that it's incredible that even the journalists who follow this stuff very carefully do not know all the conflicts that Mr Carney admits that he has now he claims that somehow this money goes gets funneled through a Bermuda tax Haven only to come back to Canada well why wouldn't he just leave in Canada in the first place if it were going to be taxed in Canada he wouldn't need to funnel it through Bermuda I don't know how many of you funnel your Investments through Bermuda before you bring them back to pay taxes I think the answer is zero you know and so Mr Carney makes these workers who are struggling to pay their bills pay full taxes in Canada while he ships his Investments off to Bermuda to dodge his AB his obligations to this country that's money that should be going in tax revenue to fund our schools and our hospitals but instead it's going to pad the pockets of millionaires and billionaires like him he thinks that taxes are just for the little people not for Big Shot Bankers like him this is exactly the wrong kind of experience we need in a prime minister and the worst kinds of conflicts of interest he will use he says by the way he says he knows how the world works he thinks he knows better than all these hardworking people behind me I can tell you they know a lot of things that he has no idea about like to I'd like to see them I'd like him to come in here for a day and try to do their jobs he wouldn't he wouldn't make it through one hour way I will say it and from Messi Buu um he says he knows how the world Works he knows how to make it work for him and against you and that is exactly what he will do as prime minister
