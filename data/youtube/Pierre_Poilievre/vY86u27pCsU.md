## Transcript

there's something that's really been worrying me after Justin Trudeau named Mark Carney his economic adviser giving him massive power over public policy in Canada Mr carney went over for meetings in Beijing where he just had secret talks with the deputy governor of the Chinese central bank two weeks later Brookfield got a quarter billion loan what did they talk about what did Mr carney in his com in his role as Trudeau's economic adviser offer China why would he be having secret meetings with top bank governmentont controlled bankers about getting a4 billion dollar loan while he was supposed to be acting in Canada's interest as the prime minister's economic adviser why would he be collaborating with a hostile foreign regime that we have since learned executed four Canadians and took numerous Canadians hostage for a lengthy period of time and given that Mr carney knows that he still owns massive financial interests in Brookfield which owes a4 billion to a Chinese state controlled bank how do we know he's not going to act against our interests in favor of his financial interests why didn't he stand in front of this microphone and confess to Canadians that he owes the Chinese government that kind of money is this why he's covering up his financial interests and given that China has has murdered our people taken our people hostage how is he ever going to stand up to foreign interference when he is so financial financially compromised we have never in our history had a weak outofouch leader so terribly compromised and conflicted whose interests go against our national interests and I call on Mr carney right now to come before a microphone today and explain if this loan is still in place and if he still has those Brookfield assets that he had up until a few weeks ago because we cannot trust someone some could you imagine what you're supposed to be advising Canada's prime minister on the well-being of our economy going to a foreign regime that had executed Canadian citizens taken Canadians hostage that we had it had already in public that they had interfered in multiple elections they've done incursions into our northern waters mark Carney will never be able to protect our national interests because he has massive financial conflicts of interests overseas what we need now is not to give the Liberals a fourth term with a weak and compromised leader what we need is a prime minister who will put Canada first for a change

Why won't Mark Carney reveal all his conflicts to Canadians? 

Is it because he owes a hostile foreign regime? Is it because his interests are against Canada's interests?
