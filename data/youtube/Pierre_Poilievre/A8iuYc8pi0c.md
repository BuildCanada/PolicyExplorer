## Transcript

imagine this you worked hard for 40 years built a life raised a family you're ready to step away from the full-time grind and you've earned it but that doesn't mean you're ready to hang up the skates entirely you're in good shape you want to contribute you want to Mentor young workers lend your knowledge to a local business or maybe just work part-time to structure the days and provide a nice little bit of extra income but there's a problem every dollar you earn comes at a cost right now the government claws back seniors benefits and taxes their earnings meaning they often work more to bring home less for example if you're making $25,000 a year and decide to work a little more to bring that up to 35,000 a year you could lose up to half of your additional earnings in clawbacks and taxes also seniors are punished for saving and investing with mandatory withdrawals from RSP that impose higher taxes on them our seniors should not have to work but nor should they be punished if they choose to we should reward rather than punish work for all Canadians my government will support seniors and let them control their own lives right now seniors get a basic personal amount that's taxfree up to $115,000 today I am announcing that a common sense conservative government will increase the basic personal amount for working seniors to $25,000 meaning seniors will be able to earn an additional $110,000 of employment income taxfree and this will save a working senior making $35,000 a year an extra 1,3 $0000 also we will not raise the retirement age and this will not affect OAS GIS and CPP payments which will continue to start at age 65 and then there's senior savings right now Canadians can save taxfree in a registered retirement Savings Plan while working but by 71 they're forced to withdraw triggering taxes and shrinking their retirement savings early this hurts seniors who want to keep working or need more time to grow their nest egg that's why I'm also announcing that my common sense conservative government will allow seniors to keep their rsps until age 73 up from 71 we'll give them two extra years to save invest and plan for retirement on their terms more control more flexibility and more Financial Security it's just common sense obviously seniors can take their money out early if they prefer but the choice should be theirs these tax savings along with income tax cuts will save seniors more and let them enjoy a happy retirement only Common Sense conservatives will lower taxes protect senior savings and build a Canada where Decades of hard work mean a great retirement in a safe and affordable home under our proud flag Canada first for a change let's bring it home [Music] [Applause]
