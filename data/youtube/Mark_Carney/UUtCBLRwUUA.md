International Leadership [Applause] prime minister Trudeau my time doesn't permit me to recognize all your accomplishments so I'll speak at a higher level you have combined strength and compassion every day as a fighter for Canada you you have led us through some of the hardest challenges that this nation has ever faced [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] V leadership Serv [Applause] not Chef mer mer mer I I pledge to you and to all Canadians that I will follow their example I will work day and night with one purpose which is to build a stronger Canada for everyone but I I will need help I will need a lot of help and so I'd like to thank Christa Frank and Karina for your energy and ideas and Leadership that you have brought to this [Applause] campaign and I would like also to thank those ministers who remained in their post to serve Canada directly during this time of great Peril and and to the incredible group of liberal MPS that we have you are the voices for your communities and you are the conscience of our party thank you for your service now to give a sense of that service I'm going to quote from a message that I and chrisa and Karina sorry Karina and Frank the three of us re the four of us received received from someone called Bob zettle now Bob full disclosure I know the leader of the opposition's in the full disclosure so I'm going to full disclosure full disclosure just want to get this on the table Bob goes to my church actually I go to Bob's church because he goes there a lot more frequently than I do anyways point is Bob wrote to the four candidates and he said I quote right now everyone sees the main threat as the Trump tariffs but the far greater challenge will be as it always has been to Foster unity and a sense of the common good there are those who will seek Power by dividing us we'll get to that later on and we need we being the people of Canada we need you you my fellow candidates myself to continue in positions of leadership to promote a United candada a commitment a commitment to common good and the respect and the rule of law throughout the world see I quote Bob because right now all Canadians are being asked to serve in their own ways we're all being called to stand up for for each other and for the Canadian way of life so let me ask you who's ready who's ready to stand up for Canada with me 100% yes yes yes Canada yes Canada the liberal party is United and strong and ready to fight to build an even better country now I feel like everything in my life has helped prepare me for this moment two months ago I put up my hand to run for leader because I felt we needed big changes but big changes Guided by strong Canadian values the values I learned at the dinner table from my parents Bob and verley and my three siblings Brenda sha and Brian values that I learned at the hockey ranks of Edmonton from my coaches such as storman Norman Lee he exists we didn't call him that to his face by the way but that was his my parents were teachers and they stressed the importance of hard work of community and of Tolerance my coaches were dedicated volunteers who taught me the importance of teamwork ambition and because it's Canada humility de de Val canadi gener Canadians know that new threats demand new ideas and a new plan they know that new challenges demand new leadership Canadians want positive leadership that will end Division and help us build together and to respond my government will put into action our plan to build a stronger economy to create new trading relationships with reliable trading partners and to secure our borders what CL Trump now I am a pragmatist above all so when I see that something's that not working I will change it so my government will immediately eliminate the divisive consumer carbon tax on families and farmers and small and mediumsized businesses and we will stop and we will stop the hike in the capital gains tax because we think Builders we think Builders should be incentivized for taking risks and rewarded when they succeed [Applause] Canada needs more of this type of change change that puts more money in people's pockets change that makes our companies more competitive change that builds the strongest economy in the G7 now there is there's someone who's trying to do the opposite there's someone who's trying to weaken our economy yeah Donald Trump Donald Trump and Donald Trump as we know has put as the Prime Minister just said unjustified tariffs on what we build on what we sell on how we make a living he's attacking Canadian families workers and businesses and we cannot let him succeed Ed and we won't we won't I am proud I am proud of the response of Canadians who are making their voices heard and their wallets felt I I am grateful for how our provinces are stepping up to the fight because when we are united we are Canada strong the the Canadian the Canadian government has rightly retaliated and is rightly retaliating with our own tariffs that will have Maximum Impact in the United States and minimum impact here in Canada and my government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect [Applause] and and until they can join us in making credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade as chrisa did yeah and in the meantime we will ensure that all the proceeds all the proceeds from our tariffs will be used to protect protect our workers Amer not not ter not not F de the Americans want our resources our water our land our country think about it if they if they succeeded they would destroy our way of life in America healthc care is a big business in Canada it is a right thank you thank you um America America is a Melting Pot Canada is a mosaic [Applause] [Applause] E for commcial yeah look Canada America is not Canada and Canada never ever will be part of America in any way shape or we look we didn't ask for this fight we didn't ask for this fight the Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves so the Americans they should make no mistake in trade as in hockey Canada will win o Chi man show extraordin [Applause] [Applause] now Donald Trump is trying to weaken our economy but there's someone else who if he succeeds will weaken our economy it's Pierre POV Pier Pier POV just doesn't get H he is the type of lifelong politician and I've seen this type around the world a lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having made a payroll himself and now and now in the face of President Trump's threats Pier POV still still refuses to get his security clearance at a time when our national security is under threat as has never been before at a time of immense economic in security he would undermine the Bank of Canada MV M Canada CBC not Planet BL Pierre POV would let our planet [Music] burn this is not leadership it's ideology it's ideology that betrays what we as Canadians value each other it's an ideology that also represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how the economy works now unlike Pierre POV I've actually worked in the private sector I know I know I know I know how the world works and I know how it can be made to work better for all of us and that and that knowledge that knowledge is especially useful now in the service of Canadians when we must build a new economy and create new trading relationships let me tell you something else that we know that Pier POV doesn't we know that markets don't have values people do and we know we know as liberals that it's our job our job to make markets to make the economy work for all Canadians these are the most powerful tool we've ever invented they can find solutions to our greatest problems and when the private sector when the markets are governed well they deliver great jobs and stronger growth faster than anything thing but markets are also indifferent to human suffering and they are blind to our greatest needs so when they're not governed well or not at all they will deliver enormous wealth for the lucky few and hard times for the rest and in this crisis in this crisis we must help those who are hit hardest by the American tariffs well we build our strength here at home that's the right thing to do that's the fair thing to do that is the Canadian thing to do that is what makes us [Music] strong so so Donald Trump thinks thinks he can weaken us with his plan to divide and conquer Pierre pov's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him not stand up to him the p Pier pov's slogans are not Solutions his anger is in action his division is in strength division won't win a trade War division won't pay the rent or the mortgage division won't bring down the price of groceries division won't make Canada strong [Applause] americ am set by [Applause] put for Canada for [Applause] now I I've learned a few things from long experience in crisis and the first is that plan beats no plan and you need to distinguish what you can change from what you can't we can't change Donald Trump can't change met sh new and we can and because we're Masters in our own home we can control our economic Destiny with a plan that puts more money in your pockets a plan that will ensure your government spends less so Canada can invest more a plan a plan a plan that builds millions of homes a plan that makes us an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy a plan that creates new trade corridors with reliable Partners a plan that creates one Canadian economy not 13 because in Canada we are are stronger when we're [Applause] united we can give ourselves far far more than Donald Trump can ever take [Music] away but it will it will take extraordinary efforts it won't be business as usual we will have to do things we haven't imagined before at speeds we didn't think possible we will do it we will do it for the common good so that everyone everyone [Applause] benefits you know I do care about the economy but it's not because I'm an economist it's because I care about people that's why I'm a liberal that's why we are liberals Val economy [Music] for for so we need a strong economy but when we're fighting for a strong economy we're fighting for good Canadian health care for everyone we are fighting for strong support for our seniors who built this country we are fighting we are fighting for child care for young families the that they put in place we are fighting for dental care and pharmacare for everyone who needs it we are fighting for rights uh we are fighting for a strong economy so we can create a more sustainable world for our children and grandchildren and we will deliver I know I know that these are dark days Dark Days brought on by a country we can no longer Trust we are getting over the shock but let us never forget the lessons we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other we need to pull together in the tough days ahead and so to those families watching this evening in Fort Smith in Edmonton and across every community in Canada I promise you this together we can and we will get through this crisis we we can and we will come out stronger than ever and we will because Canada is built on the strength of its people from from our minds to our ports from our logging roads to our city streets we're strongest when we're United when we're one economy not 13 when we can cheer for different teams and still be on one team when it counts when we come together when we come together we build things that last because we are Canada strong V Canada me it's time to win [Music]
