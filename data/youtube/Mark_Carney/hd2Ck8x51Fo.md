## Transcript

one of the brightest lights after the darkness of 911 came from a remote town in Eastern Canada and that light is still shining I had an amazing day in Gander you know what touched me the most I mean many aspects every every aspect of that story is amazing and the individual acts of kindness how uh people came together how many of the passengers uh responded themselves many of the passengers sort of stepping aside not taking the mats offered saying those others uh who were uh more in but I think one of the things that touched me the most is uh Diane um does some talks to schools here in Canada around North America and she showed me a thank you card she uh received from a young girl called Ellie uh and it said at the end it said your kindness motivates me to be more kind and you know it's a real lesson um you know we're kind or the people of Gander uh have been kind and they were kind because for kindness sake uh but that lesson is one that we all can take um about kindness and uh kindness begets kindness uh Canadians are are compassionate people they're generous people um and the story here the experience here really has made us a better country you know when I think about the values that I learned uh growing up uh from my parents from my hockey coaches uh in Edmonton one of the core values was a about the importance of community uh and tolerance and generosity and those come together and what we saw here in Gander what these women and those around them their neighbors their friends the people of Gander what they demonstrated is they live that generosity that compassion and they demonstrated a sense of community and responsibility uh to people they'd never met and many cases would never see again and that's what it's at state so it's are we coming together for a better Canada or is it everyone for themselves I prefer that we come together and I know the spirit of what happened right here in Gander and the spirit of the people of Gander is the same as the spirit of the people of Canada
