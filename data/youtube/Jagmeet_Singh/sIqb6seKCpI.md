## Transcript

how are you I'm doing all right I just trying to make me against all the odds look as beautiful as possible the odds are in your favor sir how are you I'm doing all right I think this is a a really good opportunity Senator I know a lot of people are really worried about what what the tariffs could mean what Donald Trump presidency could mean I know in Canada people are really worried about it I hear it all the time people are worried about the tariffs for example the threat of tariffs and how that's going to make life harder for Canadian workers losing jobs people are worried about the cost of things going up at a time when they're already so squeezed with the cost of living so I hope people seeing us chatting together just even the fact that we're trying to find ways to work together will give people some hope at a time when they need some hope that there's ways for us to build build together and find ways to to push back so I'm really honored that we got a chance to chat well thank you very much and thanks for the good work that you have been doing for so many years I live as you know 50 miles away from the Canadian border that's right we see Canada as um brothers and sisters Canadian people as our brothers and sisters and obviously our goal is to go forward together to improve life for people on both sides of the Border we are not enemies uh we are friends long history Long positive history we must uh continue that history against those who for whatever reason want to divide us up I I agree with that and maybe just to set the stage a bit uh Senator what does it mean uh on your end I think it would help people to know what you think the impact of if we start with the tariffs what would the impact be on people in your state in Vermont and how would impact the working class in America as a whole well look we it's hard to answer uh that question Jag me because you know Trump talks in generalities so we don't know uh I believe and have always believed in fair trade policies policies that benefit workers throughout the world and not just uh the large corporations who historically have written these trade agreements so I want to see to the degree that we have trade agreements in North America with Canada Mexico us I want to see them benefit workers at all three countries and not just make the people on top even richer but I can't really answer your question because we don't know yet what Trump is talking about but the general fear of what Trump is talking about if he imposes huge tariffs not only on Canada but countries around the world prices will s for working people in this country and obviously at a time when a lot of folks are already in uh economic economically struggling that's the last thing that we need I agree and and I think it's really fair of you Senator to point out that you don't know exactly what it means because you don't know exactly what Donald Trump's going to do and that's a really fair comment I was just thinking though that that whatever whatever the details are the general thrust of what he wants to do the general idea of what he wants to do imposing tariffs is going to hurt like that general idea would hurt workingclass people and when you mentioned fair trade versus free trade I was really thinking like that's what trade should be about how does it benefit the working people not the billionaires and what what strikes me we've got a a conservative leader Pierre PV who who does the same thing kind of puts himself out to be a fighter for the working class we got Donald Trump who puts himself out to be a fighter for the working class but what he actually does directly harms the working class every time the things that he actually does harm the working people of America and and Pier pv's ideas would hurt the working people of Canada you know it strikes me as very odd and funny that they claim to be thing but their actions show the exact opposite well um Jackie that is what historically demagogues always do uh and our job is to challenge these guys now um not all that familiar with Canadian politics or uh the current policy debate taking place in Canada but here in this country I want Canadians to know uh Trump who claims to be a great advocate for Working Families wants to give massive tax breaks to the very wealthiest people in this country at a time when we have unprecedented income and wealth inequality now I don't know who what working person thinks that makes sense and I trust that I know the people in Canada understand that we do not have what you have uh a Health Care system that guarantees Health Care to all people uh and in order to pay for his tax breaks here he wants to make massive Cuts in health care programs for our lower income folks who people are in nursing homes etc etc so I think our job on both sides of the border is to expose those politicians who claim to represent Working Families but in fact are really tools of the billionaire class and what we're seeing in America again I'm not familiar you'll tell me about Canada what we're seeing here is never four the likes of billionaires having not only economic power but political power you know we have a again I'm not familiar with Canadian campaign Finance rules but I hope Canadians understand that people like the L musk and others poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump's campaign and now intend to benefit from his victory it's scary to see that um that that amount of power concentrated in billionaires hands and it's the threat of it being used and we're already seeing it happening but the threat of it being used to the detriment of the working class to working people is really scary we have some safeguards in place where there's not that level of money being spent but we have that same concern like our our conservative leader right now that has made it very clear that he wants to attack the things that we are so proud of our our universal healthcare and even when when it first came in we always knew that it would be at risk uh the first person brought it in was a leader of the party that I represent now he always warned us that when we bring in this universal healthcare there will be vultur circling around seeing this as an opportunity to make a lot of money and they will find ways to to push back or to break the system and Pier PA recently you mentioned Elon Musk he recently was endorsed by Elon Musk and and I made the point to say he's endorsed by Elon Musk because Elon Musk knows that Pierre BV is in favor of is in the pocket of the billionaire class he wants to make billionaires even richer to the detriment of the working class and when asked about that endorsement the pier PA said oh alon's a great guy he called the guy a great guy who wants to threat he threatens to take over our country but also someone that wants to put in place laws that benefit the billionaires and hurt the working class so it's clear the type of person he is and and as you mentioned the this fear that we have of billionaires having unprecedented power not just the fact that they have so much wealth but also starting to have more and more political power is very scary to our democracy and a threat to working people right absolutely and let me just say a word on Healthcare I know there is no Health Care system in the world not in Canada not in the UK not in Europe not that is perfect but if anybody in Canada talks to you about the need to move to an American type Health Care system them let me tell you fight them back as strongly as you can because the frustration and the disgust in this country with the system that we have is deeply profound I know Canadian system is not perfect but in this country we are spending roughly speaking twice as much per person as you spend you know that we're spending if you can believe it in American dollars over 30 $1,000 for every man woman a job and when workers sit down union workers sit down at the table to negotiate a contract you know what their employer says hey our healthc care bill went up 10 10% this year I can't afford to give you a wage increase we got 85 million people who have no health insurance or are underinsured can't afford to go to a doctor 60,000 die each year because they don't get to a doctor when they should and over the years is I have led Americans into Canada in order to buy prescription drugs which cost on10th the price that they do in the United States so work on strengthening your system but you know and I know that Health Care must always be considered a human right not an entity that people make billions of dollars off which is what we have here so continue that fight and we look forward to working with you to learn from you to incorporate some of your ideas here in the United States well I appreciate that and I think people really needed to hear that Senator when you were when you were speaking about that it was really helpful I think uh for the folks are going to hopefully watch this because there is a real push going on particularly by the right-wing and the conservative leaders to to erode our system and what they're doing is uh Senator which is really it's really Insidious of them what they're doing is they are purposely starving our healthare system and they're they're underfunding it under resourcing it they're allowing more private healthare to come in which is also starving from the public system because then you've got public healthcare workers being pulled into the private system and then they're turning around saying oh the system isn't working okay ja me that is exactly I look I mean that raises a broader issue this is what's going on all over the world not just Canada not just the United States so what's going on in the NHS in the UK as well so what they do is they destroy the system and they say to people say system is not working you need to move toward more privatization and that may in fact work for the people who have the money on top but most certainly not for Ordinary People we're seeing that not only in healthcare in this country but in public education as well so let's be clear and and I I think this is the the issue the defining issue of that time you know you may have read President Biden just the other day I talked about the United States moving toward an oligarchic form of society and he's absolutely right and that is something that I've been talking about for a long time but it ain't just America you are looking at a global oligarchy led by people like Elon Musk led by some of these zillionaires uh in Saudi Arabia or Cutter uh and and in that part of the world uh all over the world you have a small number of billionaires were essentially carving up this whole planet they're getting phenomenally richer and and and working people are struggling and the poorest people are literally starving to death in sedan and elsewhere that is a struggle that every working person in Canada United States has got to recognize I think you're so right to point that out and it's it's in some ways discouraging to think about it happening around the world but it's also there's an element of that encouragement that this is a fight for all of us to be a part of all workers need to be United in this fight because it is a threat to all of us I think it's really important um I wanted to I wanted to talk about maybe some of your ideas Senator Sanders on specifically because our relationship and you touched on it is so important uh Vermont being so close to United States United States being so close to Canada that you know that relationship is so is so deep we are friends we are neighbors we are there for each other uh it is a important relationship it's a relationship that people around the world look to with envy and when they think about how how well we get along and um what Donald Trump is proposing is creating some riffs in that and and trying to challenge that I wanted to ask you thoughts on what we could do to fight back against this this Reckless plan how could we build alliances that could say to emphasize the friendship and the fact that we're good neighbors rather than the the division that Donald Trump wants to create just a and by the way call me Bernie okay for me to call you ja me right that's a very very good sir okay all right um I think let me few of the easy responses to that kind of obvious ones many of the international unions steel workers and others UAW uh are strong in both United States and Canada uh but I think it might be a good idea to expand upon that and bring uh American Trade unionists together with uh Canadian uh our brothers and sisters in Canada to see how we can work uh together again against uh Trump's reactionary ideas so I I would say an expansion uh of uh cooperation between American and Canadian unions would be one place uh that we can play a role uh number two and it's just ironic that you you rais that question uh I can tell you Justus in Vermont that we have given the fact that we border on Quebec we have far too little contact cultural contact uh educational contact with our friends in Canada and we are working literally as we speak now on improving the opportunity of of kids in Quebec to come down to Vermont vice versa uh but I think that should extend all across the border I mean here are two great countries watering each other and I'm not quite sure that people are familiar with each other to the degree that they should so I'm a big fan of exchange programs uh my City Burlington Vermont used to have uh uh a uh uh an exchange program with Burlington Ontario actually years ago oh nice okay so I I mean I would like to see that expanded Coast to Coast those are two ideas that come to my mind I think they're excellent and then particularly on the on the trade unions uh on the on the union en the labor force I think there is an incredible opportunity there because many of our unions that are amongst the strongest do have that relationship with United States and with Canada so I think there's a really there's an existing relationship we can build on that let me mention something else for you yes we need your help and you know I am an advocate of something similar to the Canadian healthc care system here in the United States so actually as we speak right now my staff I'm What's called the ranking member of the health committee uh is reaching out to Canadian Physicians and we're going to bring them down and we have in the past because you you should know as I'm sure you do that Canadian Healthcare is attacked here in the United States I assume that nobody in Canada can ever find the doctor right everyone's dying in the streets you know that's kind of what I know that I mean you got your problems obviously right I think it's important for the American people to understand how you have historically or the last 50 years what have been able to provide care to all people spending half as much as we spent and I was in Toronto a few years ago and it blew me away just talking to doctors there who were saying you know we treat all of our patients the same way we don't have to worry about whether they have this insurance policy or they can afford that we just treat them and I often in my speeches here in America say if you end up in a hospital in Canada for a month after serious surgery the bill you pay is maybe for the parking lot where you parked your car right and and people in America have a hard time even understanding that so we want to lean on you to help us understand the Canadian system how you're able to provide quality care to all for half the cost that we spent oh we can absolutely help you with that there's a a great group of folks that are Physicians who are in favor of and want to defend Medicare and and they're a great group of folks I know them really well and they they're the the Physicians who who believe in their heart that this is this is the morally right way to do things that as you mentioned anyone can walk into a Canadian hospital and you could be um an ex extremely wealthy professional you can be a workingclass person you're going to get the same quality of amazing care the the top-of-the-line care we've got a a sick Children's Hospital in Toronto which is world class and it doesn't matter who your parents are how rich they are how poor they are if a kid goes into that hospital they're getting Cutting Edge topof thee World care to make sure that those kids are healthy again and and it it's something that gives me a lot of Pride when I think about that like you should just what I was you know sometimes we take things for granted you know yeah but you should be as a nation enormously proud of that that is a tremendous accomplishment in advancing The Human Condition I mean that is so I hope all Canadians are probably that obviously want to continue to make it better and better you want to fight those who want to destroy it uh but take pride in what you've accomplished I appreciate that um I want to touch on two more areas if I could I I guess I should have added on on the building alliances I think it's also important for us to have relationships with likeminded politicians across the borders that we can build together and build a movement where we can talk about how we can strengthen our relationship we can build a brighter future as good neighbors and one where we lean on that principle of fairness that fair trade where it benefits workers on both sides of the Border I really appreciate that sentiment so I'm in favor of that I wanted to ask your thoughts um Bernie on on maybe if you could give your insight into I know you've been asked this question before and you've provided really good insights but maybe just for the folks that might listen to this your insights on on where in the States you feel like the Democrats maybe missed out on speaking to the working class and why that happened perhaps a bit of your maybe diagnosis of the problem I think there's a similar we can learn from that because we're in a similar situation where we've got to push back against a right-wing conservative leader who is really appealing to the working class what are some lessons you think that we can learn from in building a a better Progressive Movement for the working class for working people where we could learn from the things maybe you think didn't go the way they should have in the last campaign um just to set the record Jack text answering asking that question I have always run as an independent who caucuses with the Democratic party and the reason I run as an independent is I have always been deeply concerned that the Democratic party has not been as strong as it should be in taking on corporate interest and standing with the working class uh so let me just give you a little bit of background what how I perceive things going and where we are in the United States uh and again you'll forgive me for not knowing as much about the situation in Canada that's okay economically or or politically but here in America you have 60% you know people say America oh you're a wealthy country right we're the richest country on Earth Do You Know Jack meat that as you and I speak right now 60 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck wow I don't know if that phrase is used in Canada but what it means here is you work hard and at the end of the week you got nothing left if your kid gets sick or if your rent goes up or if your car breaks down you got zero and that means 60% of the people in the richest country on Earth the United States are living under enormous stress that's reality number one and then you got the poorest people who are really struggling uh we have a massive hous not only do we have a health care crisis which is different than what you have in Canada because people can't afford to go to the doctor here we have a housing crisis which means that 800,000 Americans are homeless and you got millions of people who are spending 40 50 60% of their limited incomes for housing you got a situation where we have if you're a workingclass person in America sending your kid to child care you know what child care cost him for month I don't know what it cost in Canada 20 it $20,000 for a kid wow all right so you're making $50,000 a year how the hell do you pay $20,000 for one kid how do you pay for rent and everything else meanwhile while working class people in America are struggling people on top have never ever ever had it so good there's more income and wealth inequality that ever exists said in America three people own more wealth on the bottom half of American society Mr musk at the top all right massive income and wealth inequality massive concentration of ownership in media I I think this is a Canadian problem as well what we're seeing is big money people controlling the media pushing increasingly not only a right-wing line but massive amounts of disinformation ly and musk is at the h at the top of that effort uh and then in America again different than Canada a billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars to elect their candidates so what the Democrats I think have failed to do is a recognize the severity of the pain that people are feeling when Trump goes around the country went around the country say the system is broken is it working for you people say no ain't working for me can't afford Healthcare can't afford education can't afford housing by in the last 50 years in America real inflation accounted for wages have actually gone down for the average American worker so people are struggling Trump understood that Democrats did that that's one second of all okay what's the remedy what do you do well here's where it's tough stuff you got to have the guts to take on the greed of these very wealthy and Powerful corporate interests and Democrats historically have not done that either and then as part of that you come up with a what I call a progressive agenda what is the progressive agenda based on it says and this is an important point at this moment in world history when you have an explosion in technology artificial intelligence robotics there is no excuse for us not being able to provide a good standard of living for all of our people if that technology benefits workers and not just the billionaire class so those are some of the issues that you know we have been uh fighting for here in the states I it was a really powerful summary of of what's going on in the states a lot of parallels to what's going on in Canada we we similarly while we have some really good social safety net in place we do have a lot of struggles as well we are also experiencing an unprecedented cost of living crisis and particularly a housing crisis as well where people are spending like mentioned uh more than half of their paycheck on on on housing so that's a similar really big concern and we also see um the housing market itself working phenomenal for big developers and big investors but it does not work for the working class and that's something that we've been pointing out uh a lot of similar worries about about the system not working for every day folks you see the billionaire class making more money than ever in Canada and we pointed it out in in one of our big issues is the cost of food and we've got only a handful of of grocery corporations that basically run the grocery Market in Canada and they're making unprecedented profits while Canadians are struggling with buying their groceries so that's we we pointing that out and and I think people don't feel like I think in general there's a lot of cynicism they don't think that anyone's going to fix the problems for them because they haven't seen it been fixed before so part of what we tried to do and we had an opportunity politically in a in something which called a minority government it gave us more leverage and so we tried to bring in real concrete changes to people's Liv so we brought in a dental care program and Bernie the the program helped a million people in our country fantastic get their teeth looked after a million people were able to go to the dentist um the program should when it's all said and done if we can get it to the next phase cover nine million we got 40 million people in Canada that's almost one in four person would be able to get this program and get their teeth looked after and that's a big deal for seniors who came to me with horrible stories where they their teeth were so bad that they couldn't eat they would be in pain they ate ja me I am so glad you know there are some people out there say dental care what what what is that about right but you are absolutely right and I talk about that here in this country as well how do you talk about health care without talking about dental care in the United States it cost a fortune to go to a dentist many seniors well I I won't go to the song and dance but I really am glad that you're focusing on Dental Care as part of healthare excellent yeah I really think it it should be a part of healthcare so we we we pushed for that we got that we wanted to show workingclass folks that not only can we talk about Solutions but we can actually get stuff done for you we can actually concretely make things happen so we were able to get that we pushed uh for a law that would cover diabetes medication for free as well as birth control and so that law is there we're hoping to get some deals signed before the election happens but that's another concrete thing that we tried to show if you have someone that's actually interested in the working class you're going to get policies you're going to get decisions that improve the material conditions of your life that actually make a difference in your lives and so we wanted to show that that was my My Hope was that if we could show that we can make a diffence we can give people that hope that you know we can take on these big problems look at what we've done here we can take on those big problems and we can make life better for people are you you made a point a moment ago which is absolutely true in America is that people feel are giving up on whether or not they believe government can even respond to their needs that's what Trump picked up on uh how are you in Canada and we have not solved this by any means you know I've tried and some step forward and a step backwards how are you invol in people in the political process when you talk about you know you ask me about the Democratic party it is no secret it is a top- Down Party big money plays a role Consultants play a role it does not involve at the Grassroots level ordinary people are you able to address that encounter you having some success I think we could do a better job of it I think it's something that it's an ongoing struggle so it's really important but we do have a very uh membership based like our movement is really based on on members and and our tradition as a party we were founded by created by unions and Farmers actually came together to create our party so we've got strong roots in unions and one of the things that we're really proud of so I have a the party structure I'm the leader of the party well we have a party president and then we have an executive of the party uh nearly every single member of my executive so my my president my vice president uh the executive members nearly every single person in my party that is the executive body that makes the decisions that helps direct where we're going as a party every single member of that executive is a member of a labor union wow from the president who is a former president of a Federation of Labor representing a province so she was previously the president of a Federation of Labor so that represents all the unions in a particular Province she is my president my vice president is currently a vice president in the similar to the American version that of the Labor uh movement that represents all of the Union in America she is the vice president of that for Canada so we really are proud that our executive body is made up of union members and so I point to that to say imagine the type of decisions I'm going to be making as a leader of a party when my party executive is made up of members who are workers themselves they are union workers are you that's fantastic and that does not exist in the United States so congratulations for having it all right well listen uh maybe we should get back to where we started in that we are two great countries and I think we should also be cognizant of our third country in the hemisphere of Mexico yeah who we want to work with and they have new leadership there uh but bottom line we have so much in common we cannot allow uh Trump or any right-wing politicians in in Canada trying to divide us up uh let's improve our Communications let's improve our exchanges let's get to know each other better it's been an honor and a pleasure to chat with you J me and and we look forward to continuing that well thank you so much Bernie and I'll take you up on that I think we have a lot to build on we have a a strong relationship like I mentioned and envy of the world in a lot of ways and let's build on that let's find ways to build with our our labor and our Trade union movement that can keep us on the same track Let's uh make sure folks like you and I can stay in touch so that we can build that that connection over the borders and I like the cultural exchange idea as well the more we get to know each other the better so beautiful idea so thank you for all that thank you for the time I'm honor to chat with you Bernie thank you take care bye bye take care you too
