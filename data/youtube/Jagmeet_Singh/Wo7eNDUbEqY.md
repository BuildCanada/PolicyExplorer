## Transcript

all right you're going to join me on a little Adventure so my team put together a bunch of pictures and I'm just going to straight up react to them I think you call it live reaction so I'm going to live react to these pictures come with me on this journey and this little adventure and we'll break down these pictures all right this first one I'm wearing a shirt you can't really fully see but it says right to choose this was during pride in Toronto and it was right around the time when there were a lot of things happening in the states that were attacking the right to choose so I wanted to rep how important that right is that we need to make sure we expand access to the right so I was wearing that this is pride in Toronto CU you can see some of the pride Flags in the background and I was just meeting some folks and having a good time so there's Toronto Pride all right next one oh yo this was a good time honestly every time I see this and I haven't seen it in a while every time I'm reminded of this I'm like why are we not doing more of these type of videos we need to do more twitch Stream So This is a twitch stream where I played Among Us with AOC uh Hassan Hassan ABI shout outs to Hassan ABI and um a number of other great folks on that as well but anyways AOC twitch stream great great time playing Among Us I know Among Us is a fun game too but I don't call it oh we got Dan here making a guest appearance hi danu okay next one oh this one is very special D you got to see this one this BCT oh we got anad coming through too an so this is a video or this is a picture during the campaign office in bernabe when we were running for a seat gr kiden was heavily involved in the campaign so she's out there giving some suggestions I'm looking real serious cuz we really need to win this one so yeah good memories Burnaby South the campaign office when we were going for uh going for MP Member of Parliament so good memories fighting for people to you next one all right I think folks know this one this is pretty uh became pretty viral this is when I confronted that guy that was harassing a bunch of people on the hill and I had enough so I came up to him and I said you know what's up what you what you what are you trying to do here so confronted bullies but honestly a little bit behind the scenes there was a couple of there's like four or five guys that were on Parliament Hill for the past like when this video happened maybe the past 3 or 4 days and they were harassing everybody particularly women though a number of my MPS my colleagues came to me and said that they were being harassed by these guys or being rude heckled and so I don't I I can't stand a bully like I can't stand when people bully others so what I know from experience is when you confront a bully they often back down and if you saw the video the guy fooled it pretty quickly so yeah that was that video all right what else we got [Music] here oh yo this is a really good memory this is in Montreal and I was at this is George St Pierre this is one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time George St Pierre this is at his gym where uh called TriStar where farra zahabi was one of the best trainers in the world he trains so this is really exciting meeting George St Pierre was great but it was also maybe just as great if not cooler to meet Faraz zahabi who is this epic trainer uh and great mind when it comes to mix martial arts anyways this was an awesome moment really special we filmed a video for the Quebec campaign like an ad showing me kind of training a bit because I've been involved in mixed martial arts and Jiu-Jitsu and wrestling and boxing kickboxing like forever like throughout my life I've been training in one form or another of martial arts so this is really cool really special moment [Music] okay very cute this is very sentimental this is me and my mom oh I have to see what that video is this is me and my mom uh when we were in newfa Labrador in the city of St John's actually my brother and I went back to the same place where our home was where where this video picture was taken the home is no longer there it's been torn down but the area where it's was right across from bowering Park also known as boring Park wish my mom always called it boring Park I'm like I don't think you're saying it right but it turns out that is how people in in St John's refer to this very very nice park in the city that we lived across from so yeah so we're just hanging out here in our home in St [Music] John's uh this video is this is one of the times I spoke in Parliament with unud oh this is a a screenshot from a video uh this is hod my elder daughter and she's given a real like sassy side eye to the camera there which is very cute uh and this is one of the one of the first times that I spoke in Parliament with her and she did a great job she was very chill so yeah shout outs to anhad and bringing her to [Music] Parliament uh this is a little embarrassing this picture here I am trying to do like a a film version of a selfie I guess because I'm taking a a picture of myself in a mirror so I had glasses back in the day probably going through a little bit of my uh awkward growth phase growth stage grow spt you know when you're an awkward teenager so yeah this is a very random cute little embarrassing picture of me taking a picture of myself using a mirror with a film [Music] camera oh yeah this is a very special moment this is where uh we won leadership this was like an incredible moment we had fought so hard we had an incredible team I see a lot of the faces of folks that were incredible parts of my Vol like my volunteer team my mom and dad are in the shot and then there are a number of MPS actually in the background I see Peter Julian I see um yeah a bunch of folks this is very beautiful lots of great memories looking at that one okay what else we got here injury to one is injury to all this is when we went on the picket line supporting the port workers the ILWU when they were on strike in BC so it was very cool very uh meaningful because I've often shown up to to picket lines and and stood on the line with them and supported workers fighting back against bosses that take advantage of them I think Dy might have had [Music] enough oh this is so cute this is me and Lori IDL out Member of Parliament for nunit and that picture is actually an so this is uh anhad me and Lori elau and we're in ealt in uh nunit and so in the background you see some of Callo it and it is one of the most unique places in Canada it's above the tree line so there's no trees it is this rugged yet beautiful backdrop of of snow and rocks and Hills but it's also amazing that there are so many ways that the Inuit found to not just survive but to thrive ways of finding food where you would not think there's any food but there's plentiful uh food from the land that the community is every to find so yeah this is we're going for a little walk around [Music] aalt oh this is cool this is very special so so um Mary shortle is the president of our party she was formerly the president of the Federation of Labor for Newland in Labrador so that's Mary sh and you might tell from our jackets but we went on a motorcycle ride so this is Kitty viy I grew up in St John so it's very special to me this is a very beautiful
