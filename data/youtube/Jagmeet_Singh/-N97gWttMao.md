## Transcript

the Prime Minister needs to come clean with all the facts we need to know all the evidence possible we needed to see some evidence uh I think we need to see more facts um prime minister hasn't provided any facts no evidence presented politically motivated let me see what the concrete evidence she's talking about as I'm concerned we need to have uh the evidence I need to know what are the uh evidence that you have so that I go prepared Canada has provided credible irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the government of India and a murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil I love our country I love our democracy I would do anything to protect it I can't imagine or understand any political leader who wouldn't also do anything to protect our country it troubles me deeply that Pierre PV is unwilling to receive security clearance and to fully understand what's going on I would have would have to have more evidence to make a judgment on that does that sound like a leader that's taken this seriously he doesn't sound like someone who cares youve got these serious allegations that a foreign government literally hired gangs in Canada to go out and shoot up people's homes and people's businesses Canadians lives are put at risk does that sound like the response of a leader who's taking it seriously
