## Transcript

give yourselves a big round of applause for all the work you do as delegates as activists thank you thank you I love our country and the reason why I say that is Canada's best policies they didn't happen by accident or by chance they happened because the NDP and labor together fought for them Universal healthc care we did that public pensions we did that pharmacare dent mental care workers rights we did that together we did that together and right now right now in Manitoba wob Cano's NDP government is showing us what real leadership looks like they're hiring nurses expanding health care and fixing the damage left by the conservatives and they just signed the first ever agreement for Universal pharmacare we made that happen together in British Columbia David E's NDP government is standing up for working people expanding affordable child care building thousands of homes and taking on the profiteers that are driving up rent when new Democrats are in charge people's lives get better new Democrats have never just talked about change we have delivered it and that's why I'm running to be your prime minister you see the Canada we love the one we love the one we built together is under attack we've got corporations raking in record profit while families are struggling to afford their groceries housing costs are out of control while billionaires are buying up our cities QB has been on the front lines of the fight against privatization you know what this is about but you know what Mark Carney tried to secure a deal to privatize Hydro 1 so we could deliver profits instead of affordable energy Frontier ience and not only does Pierre PV believe that the private sector should be delivering Healthcare he held a fundraiser right here in Montreal at a multi-million dollar mansion of Aaron Stern Aaron Stern who owns multiple private American for-profit hospitals so what did Pierre P have promise Aaron Stern in exchange for those donations well I can tell you what I believe in I do not believe in privatization I do not believe in breaking your Healthcare instead I believe in fixing our Universal public made in Canada Health Care system and the first step is to respect healthcare [Applause] workers that means better pay better work conditions and having enough healthcare workers in every department on every shift so you're not burnt off and run off your feet see the conservatives they choose Health Care Cuts they choose privatizing services and selling out Canadian workers and that comes at a cost for everyday families the Liberals they make big promises but ultimately they choose to keep working for the rich instead of for you not me I choose you working people families everyday folks we've seen the story before we've seen what happens when right-wing governments take over cuts to healthare attacks on workers and giveaways to the ultra Rich they have the same Playbook they do it again and again we can't afford to let that happen not not here not now not ever friends we will not be taken over by the us we will never be the 51st state there can be no appeasement of Donald Trump there is only resistance [Applause] resistance but we can't resist Donald Trump by making Canada more like the us we hear from people telling us that the way through this challenge is to cut taxes for the wealthy to fire workers delivering the services we need and to destroy Health Care by allowing American sty privatization we all know that is the wrong path it won't take us forward to the Canada of our dreams the Canada we dream of is one where we put working people and Families First that's why that's why I've called for an emergency session of parliament to put together a package of supports of workers the terrorists present an existential threat families could lose their homes if we don't help children could go hungry we cannot leave working people in the cold waiting for EI going without enough money to buy groceries we can help we must help and we have to fight back and the greatest way we fight back is by protecting in and creating jobs for Canadians by building and buying [Applause] Canadian so let's build hospitals build homes build Bridges build highways build an eastwest electricity grid let's address the crumbling infrastructure in our communities and do it with 100% Canadian content Canadian steel Canadian aluminum Canadian workers let's get Canadians to work friends I believe the future shouldn't be decided in corporate boardrooms the future should be decided in living rooms and around kitchen tables by everyday Working Families this election is our chance to stand up to fight back to build the Canada we deserve the powerful don't give us change we have to take it so let's organize let's vote let's fight because Canada is worth it now to those who think we should just throw in the towel in the upcoming election to those who think the only choice is between Mark Carney or Pierre POV let me remind you every election people ask us why we don't just join the Liberals and to you I say this because we believe in more we believe in better we believe in building a country that works for working people not for billionaires we cannot we must not settle for a choice between cuts and more Cuts you deserve better than [Applause] that under the Liberals you're stuck with the same broken healthc care system soaring costs and a housing crisis that never gets fixed under the conservatives you face drastic Cuts layoffs and the destruction of the very Services you depend on Canada needs the NDP now more than ever we need a government that's in it for you with a proven history of making lives better together we can build the future you deserve and as Jack always said don't let anyone tell you it can't be done we won't let them tell us it can't be done missu thank you thank you so much
