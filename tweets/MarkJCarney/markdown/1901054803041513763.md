I spoke with Prime Minister Starmer, President Zelenskyy, and many of our closest allies this morning to discuss Ukraine’s path to peace.

Canada supports the proposal for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. Now, Russia must stop stalling and launching its attacks. It’s time for Russia to come to the table in good faith. As the G7 agreed at Charlevoix, we will tighten the monitoring of sanctions to encourage compliance.

Canada is Ukraine’s steadfast ally. We will make sure Ukraine has the military support it needs to defend itself — now and into the future.
