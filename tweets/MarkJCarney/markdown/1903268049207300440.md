The premiers and I are focused on building one strong Canadian economy.

It’s time to break down internal trade barriers. It’s time that workers certified in one province are allowed to work anywhere in the country. It’s time to build big things without rounds of red tape.

We’re stronger when we’re united, and it’s time to unite.
