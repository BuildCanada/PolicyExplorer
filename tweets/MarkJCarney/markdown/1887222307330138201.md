President Trump's proposed forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza is deeply disturbing. It would violate the rights of Palestinians and international law, and it would set back efforts to promote peace and security for all in the region.

I support the hard work of reaching a two-state solution, with a viable and free Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the state of Israel.

The priority must be the completion of the first phase of the ceasefire and massive support for Palestinian families in Gaza in rebuilding their homes and lives.
