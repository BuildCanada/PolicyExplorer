These tariffs are an unjustified, direct attack on Canadian workers, families, and businesses.

Canada should retaliate with dollar-for-dollar tariffs that will have maximum impact on the US and minimum impact on Canada. The proceeds from our tariffs should be used to protect our workers.

The unpredictability of US trade policy underscores the imperative of Canada using every tool at our disposal to build the strongest economy in the G7.

We didnâ€™t ask for this fight, but Canadians are united and determined. In trade, as in hockey, we will win.
