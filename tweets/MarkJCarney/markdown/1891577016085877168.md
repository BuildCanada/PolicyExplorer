This reprehensible  vandalism is another reminder that Jewish Canadians have been targeted by a rising wave of antisemitism, particularly since October 7th.

It has to stop. As Canadian leaders, we need to say firmly and loudly that the Jewish community has the right to feel safe in Canada.  

I continue to extend my full support to the Jewish community as we work to combat hate and ensure the perpetrators of these heinous acts are brought to justice.
