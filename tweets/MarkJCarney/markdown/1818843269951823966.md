Wow. Indeed the end of an era and a great Edmonton institution. Sponsor of many a sports team including the Parkview peewee hockey team that I and @AlexPourbaix played for just a few decades ago. Thanks Andy’s for all the great service and huge commitment to our community.  #yeg

**Andrew Knack (@AndrewKnack):** It’s the end of an era. Andy’s IGA is officially closed after 59 years of service to so many Edmontonians. It’s a reminder of a time when grocery stores specialized in great customer service and great food. Thank you Andy for your decades of service! #yeg #yegcc https://t.co/wTqCaGKQpM
