**Kody Blois (@KodyBloisNS):** It’s been an incredible few days in Nova Scotia with the next leader of our Party, and Canada’s next Prime Minister - @MarkJCarney.

This morning, Mark announced that he would eliminate the carbon tax, and replace the policy with an incentive program that will reward Canadians for making green choices.

Then this afternoon, we stopped at Ledwidge Lumber in Enfield to chat with the Ledwidge family about the importance of our local forestry sector. 

We also popped into Shooters Bar & Grill  for a lunch-to-go, before heading to a packed house at the Enfield Legion filled with supporters from across Kings-Hants. 

Finally, I joined Mark to speak and meet with more supporters in Truro and Amherst about his plan for our party, our province - and our country. 

I’m supporting Mark because in the world we’re living in, we need an experienced leader like him, at the helm, now more than ever.
