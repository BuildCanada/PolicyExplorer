**Taleeb Noormohamed ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ (@Taleeb):** In conversations across VanGran, one thing is clear:

Canadians are looking for leadership that is clear-eyed &amp; capable, focused on building our prosperity &amp; protecting our sovereignty.  

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m proud to support Mark Carney as our next PM &amp; Liberal leader. https://t.co/H5xIy9uZA0
