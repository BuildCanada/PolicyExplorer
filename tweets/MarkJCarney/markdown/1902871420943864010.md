I met with Premier Smith in my hometown of Edmonton today. We had a detailed and frank discussion about the opportunities for Alberta and Canada during this time of crisis.  

Canada is fighting for our workers and our businesses against unjust U.S. tariffs and in a rapidly changing global economy.  

My government is focused on working with provinces and territories, Indigenous peoples, businesses, and labour to build the future with millions of new homes, new energy corridors, new trade routes with reliable partners, and one Canadian economy. 

We have to be strong as a nation — and we are stronger when we can work together.
