We’re taking immediate action to protect Canadian workers against the United States’ trade war.

We’re waiving the one-week EI waiting period. We’re making it so that you don’t have to exhaust your severance pay before collecting EI. We’re changing the system in every region to make it easier for you to access your benefits.

These are new, temporary changes. They're going to keep workers supported — and keep Canada strong against any challenge.
