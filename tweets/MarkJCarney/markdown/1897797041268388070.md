Canada’s strong response to the unjustified US tariffs is having an impact. I am proud of the united front of workers, labour, businesses, federal and provincial governments that is helping Canada to navigate through this crisis.

Today’s announcement is not enough. All tariffs and threats of tariffs should be immediately removed. Until then, Canada will not stand down, and Canadians will stand together.

If elected, my government will pursue an approach with the United States based on mutual respect and credible commitments that benefit people in both our countries.
