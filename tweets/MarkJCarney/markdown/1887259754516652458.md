# Tweet by Mark Carney (@MarkJCarney)

We can’t change the fact that there will always be shocks: like financial crises, geopolitical events, or climate catastrophes. 
 
But we need to understand what we can, and must, change.
 
Like how much of your hard-earned money you get to keep and how effective your government is. We can change how we build as a country. How we harmonise our economy and expand trade with new partners. And how we keep Canadians secure. 
 
I want you to know that I couldn’t be more serious about strengthening our economy, and protecting Canadians.
