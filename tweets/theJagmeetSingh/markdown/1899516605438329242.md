We have a choice to make.

Do we want a country that looks like Trump's America, or do we want to be true to our values, and build a Canada where we take care of one another?

Carney's plan is tax cuts for the wealthy, paid for by the workers.

But we can't put Poilievre in charge â€” he will never stand up to Trump.

Let's build a Canada that puts people first. That's what our movement will do.
