Today, Donald Trump has unleashed tariffs on Canada that will hurt all of us - and Americans.

Now is a time for Canadians to stand strong and stand together.

Our values and our solidarity will not crumble in the face of Donald Trumpâ€™s economic attack.

New Democrats will be there to protect workers. To make sure there is help for everyone impacted by these tariffs.

Canada is strong. Canadians are united.
