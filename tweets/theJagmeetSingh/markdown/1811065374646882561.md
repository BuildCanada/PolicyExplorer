Look, it's not that government can't bring prices down - it's that Liberals and Conservatives have spent decades passing laws to protect CEOs - not you.

When New Democrats proposed price caps and a plan to lower your costs - Liberals and Conservatives voted against it - giving CEOs the power to continue raising prices.

An NDP government will change the rules to remove greed from the grocery aisle.
