Shana Tova to Jewish Canadians as they celebrate Rosh Hashanah â€” the start of the Jewish New Year.

This past year has been difficult for Jewish communities who faced a painfully sharp rise in vile antisemitic hate crimes.

As we enter this New Year, let us commit to working together to build a Canada where everyone is safe to practice their faith and celebrate their traditions without fear.

I wish you a sweet year filled with peace, health, and happiness.
