On International Women's Day, I celebrate those fighting for the rights for all women, non-binary and two-spirit people.

For a Canada where the right to choose is protected.
Where you earn the same wage for the same work.
Where you control your own body.
Your own future.
And your own life.

I will always stand by you in the fight for equity.
