Andrew Mackenzie is a good New Democrat and an even better man.

He has spent his entire life organizing and on the frontlines in the labour movement and as a New Democrat.

Egoless yet strong -  he has never sought the limelight.

Today, I am honoured to present him a Lifetime Membership Award for his dedication to our movement.

Thank you Andrew.
