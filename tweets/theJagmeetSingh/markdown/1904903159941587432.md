Today, I announced a middle class tax cut.

The NDP’s tax cut will save families over $1,450 a year by cutting taxes and permanently removing GST from daily essentials.

Billionaires don’t need a break — working people do.

The ultra-rich have Liberals and Conservatives looking out for them — I’m in it for you.
