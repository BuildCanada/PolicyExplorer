This is Martine Delvaux - Martine is a hero. As an author and through her presence in the media, she reminds us that we must continue the fight against gender inequalities and defend women's rights.

Yesterday in Montreal, I had the privilege, along with @LeahGazan, to discuss feminism and women's rights with Martine.

Right now, there are groups and even politicians who are seeking to restrict women's rights, particularly regarding abortion.

With allies like Martine, we won't let them do that.
