I was honoured to celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day in Edmonton.

Thank you for having me and for the incredible celebration.

Indigenous justice in Canada requires action - starting with the federal government implementing all the Calls to Action from The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Calls for Justice from the National Inquiry into MMIWG.

Today and every day, New Democrats remain committed in the fight for justice for First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis across the country.
