Today marks three years since the horrific terrorist attack that took the lives of four members of the Afzaal family in London, Ontario.

Earlier this year, the attacker was found guilty of terrorism.

My heart is with the loved ones of the Afzaal family and the London community who continue to grieve.

I share your pain and stand with you.

Together, we must continue to fight against Islamophobia.
