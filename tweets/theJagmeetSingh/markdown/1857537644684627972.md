Happy Gurpurab to Sikhs in Canada and around the world!

Guru Nanak Sahib Ji â€” the founder of the Sikh religion, led a social revolution guided by a belief that we are all one and equal.

May his teaching continue to remind us that when we lift each other up, we all rise.

Happy Gurpurab to all celebrating!
