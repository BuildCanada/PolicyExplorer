Today, we welcomed our newest NDP MP to Parliament, Leila Dance.

Leila took on Conservatives and won - her presence in Parliament is a symbol of hope and relief.

A reminder that when we stand united, we can stop Conservative cuts and win.

Corporations have had their government, it's the people's time.
