If there is ever a fight — big bosses on one side and workers on the other — I'm always going to take the side of workers.

In Burnaby, I stand with @iamawcanada — who the bosses are trying to divide.

It won't happen — not on our watch.

Workers, united, will never be defeated. https://t.co/FXvClrOaB6
