Fun fact - I absolutely love biking! ðŸš²

I had a blast riding with @WeAreHub last weekend in Burnaby.

In honour of Go by Bike Week - I encourage all of you to take a ride.

Ride to work
With your friends
Or just for fun

It's great for your health and good for the environment! https://t.co/gVxeC3OzUx
