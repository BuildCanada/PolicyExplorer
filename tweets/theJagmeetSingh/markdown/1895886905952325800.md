I ❤️ HALIFAX.

Today, at the Halifax Brewery Market, I met some of the kindest, most generous people.

A young doctor named Yan, who talked to me about the health care system and the work we need to do to strengthen it. 

A market board member, who is a champion for local business just like the NDP.

A really kind Polish Pierogie vendor - who sold me some of the best I’ve ever had.

And a ton of people who believe in a Canada where we look out for one another with strong social programs.
