There's a reason Trump’s buddy - Elon Musk - is campaigning for Pierre Poilievre.

It's because he knows that Poilievre has a long history of throwing workers under the bus to help out a billionaire.

He's attacked pensions and unions. He's even threatened to cut dental care, free diabetes meds, and birth control.

Every single chance Poilievre's had, he’s cut from workers and given to the ultra-rich.
