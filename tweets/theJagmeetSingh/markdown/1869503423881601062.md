More than 5 million of us in Canada donâ€™t have a family doctor. 

The population is growing, but the number of family doctors is actually dropping.

Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives say they will cut health care. They would make things worse for us all.

New Democrats will train, retain and respect family doctors and stop the long, painful and dangerous waits.
