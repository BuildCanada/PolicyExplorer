Are your grocery prices cheaper today?

One year ago, Justin Trudeau's government met with CEOs and promised Canadians to "stabilize" grocery prices.

It never happened - it never will.

Justin Trudeau is beholden to corporations and he'll let you down again - and, again.

Today I sent a letter to the minister. It’s well past time for bold action to confront corporate greed. https://t.co/Pc016wt98Q
