Canada Day is a day to acknowledge what makes our country so incredible.

It is also a day to reflect on the work ahead of us.

To continue building a more fair and just country where we uplift one another.

I love this country deeply - and I'm proud to raise both my daughters here.

Which is why I am committed to making it a better place for all.
