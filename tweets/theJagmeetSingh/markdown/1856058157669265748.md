Today, I'm at the Bonsor Park Cenotaph in my riding of Burnaby South, as we gather to honour the heroes who have served our country with courage, pride, and determination.

Their sacrifices remind us not only of the price of our freedom but also of the preciousness of peace.

On this day, we must also think of the challenges faced by our veterans and their families. They deserve our respect, but also our unwavering support.

Let us commit to fighting for them just as they fought for us. We must advocate for veterans' rights to live and retire with dignity, a good home and health care and mental health care where and when they need it.

Today, we pay tribute to the courage of our heroes, past and present, and renew our promise to serve them so they can continue to serve this great nation.

Lest we forget.
