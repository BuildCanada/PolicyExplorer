I am deeply disturbed to hear about the arson attack on a home in London, Ontario.

This attack comes just days after the anniversary of the Islamophobic terror attack that claimed the lives of members of the Afzaal family.

My heart goes out to the family whose home was attacked.

Everyone deserves to feel safe in their community.

The rise in Islamophobia we're seeing is extremely troubling - we must confront it at every instance.
