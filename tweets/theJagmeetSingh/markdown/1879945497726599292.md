Last night, Pierre Poilievre was at a lavish fundraiser in Vancouver surrounded by millionaires.

This morning he announced a tax cutâ€”but only for people earning $1.4 million per year.

He fundraises in mansions and exclusive clubs, so ordinary Canadians will pay the price for his promises.

These tax breaks for the ultra-rich come at a cost: cuts to your health care, cuts to your pension, cuts to your childcare.
