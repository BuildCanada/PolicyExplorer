Justin Trudeau has caved to corporate greed by meddling in the ports dispute, again. He's basically taken all the power away from workers and their unions.

Poilievre and his Conservatives are hiding per usual.

The NDP stand shoulder-to-shoulder with working people and unions.

We want more unionized, mortgage-paying jobs, not less. More money for workers instead of the CEOs.
