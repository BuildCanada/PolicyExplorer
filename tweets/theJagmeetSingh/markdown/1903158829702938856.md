It was a pleasure to catch up with my friend, Premier Wab Kinew today in Ottawa and talk about our shared priorities for people.

Recently, Premier Kinew's NDP government was the first to deliver free diabetes, birth control and menopause medications to people in his province.

This is life-changing for hundreds of thousands of Manitobans and I'm deeply proud of all the New Democrats who fought hard to deliver on this promise.

I look forward to continuing our work together making all medication free.
