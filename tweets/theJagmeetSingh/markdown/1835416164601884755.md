I’m in Elmwood-Transcona with our candidate Leila Dance talking to folks who are ready for another MP who’s fighting for them!
 
Together we can,
 
Fix health care.
Build homes you can afford.
Stop price gouging.
 
Corporations have had their government. It’s the people’s time. https://t.co/fzl9NCezkI
