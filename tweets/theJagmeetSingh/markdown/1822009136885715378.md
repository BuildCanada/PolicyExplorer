When racist mobs try to terrorize their neighbours, good people rise up.

What's happening in the UK is a reminder of this.

Here in Canada, those of us that believe in lifting each other up will always outnumber those that seek to tear us apart.

Whether you were born here or came to this country.

No matter your race, religion or sexuality.

Our movement will always hold space for you.

When we fight back, we win.
