#BREAKING 

If you're reading this in the morning…

It's 11:24 pm and we just secured a GST Tax Break!

For 2 months there’ll be no GST/HST on kid's clothes, diapers, more foods & other essentials.

Conservatives tried to block it — we defeated them.

For the record an NDP govt would make this a permanent tax cut and include monthly bills like home heating and your cell phone bill.
