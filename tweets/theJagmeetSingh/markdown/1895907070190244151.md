There are politicans who pretend to care about workers - but they’re really just tools for the billionaire class.

In Canada, Donald Trump and Elon Musk have found an ally in Pierre Poilievre.

Poilievre will cut-and-gut at universal health care - while giving tax breaks to the ultra-rich.

I will stop these for-profit schemes, strengthen our health care system, and ensure every Canadian has access to health care at no cost.

Because, to be Canadian, means to have each others backs. That’s who we are.
