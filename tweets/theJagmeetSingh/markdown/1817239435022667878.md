Weâ€™ve had decades of cuts and broken promises when it comes to Indigenous Child and Family Services.  

Generations have suffered.

@CharlieAngusNDP and I visited the Kunuwanimano Child & Family Services to listen carefully to the needs. 

New Democrats will work with organizations like Kunuwanimano to fix the system, invest in child and family services, and treat Indigenous children and communities with respect.
