Family, friendship, and being in community - that is what Lunar New Year is about.

I was so happy to attend the Spring Festival Parade with @DonDavies, @JennyKwanBC and @MPJulian today!

Wishing you a joyful, healthy, and prosperous year ahead.

Happy Lunar New Year! 
新年快樂！ 
Chúc Mừng Năm Mới! 
새해 복 많이 받으세요!
