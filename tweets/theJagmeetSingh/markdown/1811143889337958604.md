Rain or shine, day or night - I'll always stand with workers against Conservative cuts and privatization.

I was proud to stand on the picket line with @OPSEU workers taking on the Conservatives in Ontario.

Every worker in our country deserves wages that keep up with inflation. https://t.co/lRFRAuKnXb
