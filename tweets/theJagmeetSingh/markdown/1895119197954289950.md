Deeply disappointing for middle class families.

Hiking GST again on essential items like diapers, but promising a massive tax cut for millionaires - it's just so wrong.

Working people deserve a break - millionaires don't need any more tax breaks.

The way to fight Conservatives is to never to start acting like them.

New Democrats will permanently remove the GST off essentials and make millionaires pay what they owe.
