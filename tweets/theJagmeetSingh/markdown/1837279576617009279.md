Deeply disturbing and distressing news.

A suspect entered Centre Culturel Musulman de Châteauguay with a knife - reportedly leaving three congregants injured.

Canadians should be able to peacefully pray in their place of worship - unafraid.

My thoughts are with the Muslim community of Châteauguay.
