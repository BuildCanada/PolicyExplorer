I have been horrified by how the lives of Palestinians have been disregarded by the political establishment.

When Parliament voted on our ceasefire motion - children were being pulled from rubble and entire family lines were being wiped out.

In that moment, Marco Mendicino had a choice. He chose to side with Netanyahu and opposed a ceasefire.

Now, Mark Carney has appointed him as his Chief of Staff - his closest advisor and in one of the most powerful positions in his government.

I cannot imagine the pain and hurt this has caused so many of you.

I simply want you to know that the NDP will always stand on side of justice, peace and human rights.
