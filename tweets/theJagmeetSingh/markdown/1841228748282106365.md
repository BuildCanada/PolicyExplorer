I'm in Thunder Bay, where the Alstom Plant offers 500 good mortgage-paying jobs.

I'm calling on Justin Trudeau to immediately fund its fair share of Toronto's Line 2 subway train replacements â€” to protect and create good jobs, like the ones these Unifor Local 1075 members do, and to get new, safe trains onto Toronto's tracks.
