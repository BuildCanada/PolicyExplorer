Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, is a profound time of reflection, repentance, and renewal. 

On behalf of the NDP, I would like to extend my best wishes to all members of the Jewish faith in Canada and around the world who are gathering to observe the holiest of Jewish Holidays.

G'mar Chatima Tovah.
