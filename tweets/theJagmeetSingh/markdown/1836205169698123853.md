By now you've probably seen the video.

For days now, bullies in Ottawa have been spewing hate and harassing Canadians who don't agree with them.

An Indigenous woman being called a Nazi. Staff being harassed. Journalists being yelled at. 

Thatâ€™s the country Pierre Poilievre wants.

Me? I believe everyone should feel safe walking our streets.

I believe we need to stand up to bullies and shut down hate. 

Canadians believe in lifting each other up. Not tearing each other down.

Stand with us.
