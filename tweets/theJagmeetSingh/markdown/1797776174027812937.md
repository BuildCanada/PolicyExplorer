Today in Parliament, Pierre Poilievre tried to block free birth control and life-saving diabetes medication.  

He voted against a child born with type 1 diabetes who needs insulin to stay alive.  

He voted against a woman deciding if and when she would like to start a family.  

But he failed. Canadians won.
