Canadian greatness can be found in the mines of the North.

I took a trip into the Macassa mine with @CharlieAngusNDP and an amazing team at Agnico Eagle.

The North, these miners, and future workers here deserve a government that values and respects them — which means taking action on issues like the housing shortage.

I loved every moment I spent with my friends in the North, and I'll always have their backs.
