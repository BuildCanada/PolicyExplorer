In the next hour, I will move a motion to create a Canada-India Committee to protect Canadians and our country.

This committee will empower Parliament to dig into India's foreign and democratic interference.

Every leader must show India that we are a united front and that Modi has no ally in our Parliament.

We must put our country before party.
