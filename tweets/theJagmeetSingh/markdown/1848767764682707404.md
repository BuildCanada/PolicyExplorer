Today marks 10 years since the National War Memorial and Parliament Hill was attacked.

My thoughts are with the loved ones of Corporal Nathan Cirillo.

A Canadian hero, who bravely defended the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Parliament Hill.

We honour his memory â€” and all those who risked their lives to protect others on that day.
