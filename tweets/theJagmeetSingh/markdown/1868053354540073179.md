ATTENTION

The GST Tax Cut on Essentials starts today. 
Parents, that means:

- NO GST on Kids Snowsuits
- NO GST on Diapers
- NO GST on Grab and Go Meals

We fought to make this tax cut permanent.

The Liberals and Conservatives said NO.

It’s ridiculous. They have no issue handing out BILLIONS to corporations, but won’t give you a permanent break.

But I promise, I won’t stop fighting to bring down your bills.
