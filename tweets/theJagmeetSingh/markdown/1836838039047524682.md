New Democrats will vote against Pierre Poilievre’s motion.

Pierre's plan is to stop Pharmacare to protect Big Pharma's profits.

To cut dental care, and workers’ pensions to give more to CEOs.

Our plan is to stop Poilievre, and deliver relief.

The future of Canada and the future of the middle class are too important. We’re not going to play Pierre Poilievre's games.
