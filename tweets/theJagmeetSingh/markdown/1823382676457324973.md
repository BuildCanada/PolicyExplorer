I’m in St. John's – where everyone treats each other with so much kindness and respect.

Just like everywhere else in Canada – they don't like it when CEOs and Corporate Landlords take advantage of their community.

When they see this – they stand up.

So, together we're building a people-powered movement to change the rules to give people more power and CEOs less.
