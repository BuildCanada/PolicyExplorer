Canadian Medicare — our Universal Health Care system — says a lot about who are as a people and as a country.

It's who we are — a country where we look out for one another. 

And when Conservatives underfund and cut health care it betrays that value, and costs us all. They want to help American corporations by using sick Canadians as a cash cow for corporations. 

Our country. Our health care. 

New Democrats alongside allies like @BernieSanders will always stand with working people to protect and build up the care that families count on.
