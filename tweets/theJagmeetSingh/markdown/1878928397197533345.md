You have to stand up to bullies. 

Donald Trump and Elon Musk (more billionaires backing Poilievre) need our critical minerals.

If Trump attacks Canadian workers and jobs with tariffs, letâ€™s fight for them by cutting off the flow of critical minerals to the U.S. 

Canadians are kind and generous - but don't ever mistake that for a weakness.
