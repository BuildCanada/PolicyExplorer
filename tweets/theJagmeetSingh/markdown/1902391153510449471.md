Congratulations to Radisson Blue Vancouver Airport workers who've just secured a union contract after the longest strike in Canadian history.

I was honoured to join them on the picket line - and stand with them in their fight.

The NDP is in it for working people. Not the powerful few.

When we stand together, we will win!
