I was honoured to speak to hundreds of workers at the BCGEU convention in Vancouver.

A gathering of working people - who are organizing, resisting, and rising up against corporate greed.

Thank you Stephanie Smith for your years of service as BCGEU's President - and congratulations to incoming president Paul Finch!

New Democrats stand with you - we're a worker's party and we're unapologetic about it.
