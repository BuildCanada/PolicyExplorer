Thank you @cupenat! ✊🏽

If there is ever a fight — big bosses on one side and workers on the other — the NDP will always side with workers and with Canadians.

CEOs have had their governments.
It's the people's time.

## Quoting Tweet

**CUPE National (@cupenat):** Justin Trudeau announced that he is stepping down. There is no question that Canada needs new leadership. Instead of undoing the strides we’ve made, we need a @NDP government that will continue to build on these vital achievements &amp; that works for workers.
