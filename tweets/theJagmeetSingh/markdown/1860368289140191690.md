Last week, we pushed the Liberal government to eliminate GST from the essentials you depend on.

This week, the Liberals caved into our demands - temporarily getting rid of the GST off some essential items.

It's a step in the right direction - but we're not going to stop fighting.

An NDP government will scrap the federal tax on daily essentials, permanently.
