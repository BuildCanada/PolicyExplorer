Here’s one fact about the housing crisis – no one wants you to know.

I’m going to tell you anyway.

This crisis – has made powerful corporate landlords filthy rich – How? Liberals and Conservatives spent decades writing rules that helped them.

Right now, corporate landlords are recipients of massive corporate welfare.

Taxpayer money. Your money. Billions are redirected to landlords in a system setup by Liberals and Conservatives.

I'll put an end to that. Not a penny more will go to Bad Corporate Landlords.
