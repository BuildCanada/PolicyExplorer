Together, we can build a Canada where there is more justice, compassion and action.

A country where we all rise.

For too long Indigenous peoplesâ€™ basic human rights are denied.

Consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments chose not to uphold and honour their rights.

I want you to know - I will work for justice and for your rights to be upheld.
