In London, Ontario, A woman wearing hijab was assaulted while in the presence of her children.

In Winnipeg, a number of Islamophobic calls were made to a mosque.

Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism have no place in Canada.

Families and communities deserve to feel safe.

We must stand up against this hate.
