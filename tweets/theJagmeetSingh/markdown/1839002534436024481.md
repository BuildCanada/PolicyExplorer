The people of Lebanon are facing the deadliest violence the country has experienced since 2006.

Hundreds have been killed, including children. Now we've learned that 2 Canadians have also lost their lives amidst this violence.

All violations of International Law must stop.

The Liberal government must evacuate Canadians, push for de-escalation, and actively help pursue peace.
