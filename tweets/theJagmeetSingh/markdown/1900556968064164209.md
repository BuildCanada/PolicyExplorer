I want to congratulate Prime Minister Trudeau on his time in office, and wish him well. 

He served our country through tumultuous times. Whatever disagreements we have had, his love for Canada is always evident.

Public service is a great privilege, but can require sacrifice â€” especially for families. I know PM Trudeau has always been there for his kids, and I hope as he steps away from politics he gets to enjoy more time just being a dad.
