Today, we bid farewell to a remarkable leader and hero for Indigenous justice and rights in Canada. 

Murray Sinclair will be remembered for his tireless pursuit of justice and through his invaluable contributions to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 

His legacy will continue to inspire us and future generations. 

On behalf of New Democrats, I send heartfelt condolences to his loved ones and all who were inspired by his work.
