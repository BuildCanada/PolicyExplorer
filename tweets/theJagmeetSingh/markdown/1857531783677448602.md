Right now, over 55,000 postal workers are on strike - fighting for a fair deal and respect.

The NDP stands with them.

And we will fight tooth and nail to defend their right to free and fair collective bargaining.

Their fight is our fight.

My message to Justin Trudeau is clear: stay out of this.
