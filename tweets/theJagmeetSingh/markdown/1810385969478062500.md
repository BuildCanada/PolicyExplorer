Absolutely horrific.

Targeting a children's hospital with children inside seeking care is truly despicable.

Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine that has led to the murder of thousands of Ukrainians must end.

New Democrats stand firm in our calls for peace, justice, and democracy for Ukraine, and for all.

## Quoting Tweet

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa):** Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv. One of the most important CHILDREN’S hospitals not only in Ukraine, but also in Europe. Okhmatdyt has been saving and restoring the health of thousands of children.

Now that the hospital has been damaged by a Russian strike, there are people under the rubble, and the exact number of casualties is still unknown.  Right now, everyone is helping to clear the rubble – doctors and ordinary people.

Russia cannot claim ignorance of where its missiles are flying and must be held fully accountable for all its crimes. Against people, against children, against humanity in general. It is very important that the world does not remain silent about this now, and that everyone sees what Russia is and what it is doing.
