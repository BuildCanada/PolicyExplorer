I need you to hear Michelle's story.

She's a single mother, who starts work at 5 am to provide for her daughter.

She does everything right, like so many other Canadians.

But when she sees tax cuts for the ultra-rich — she thinks, "what about me?"

And she's right.

Our middle-class tax cut will help Canadians like Michelle by putting them first – not the ultra-rich.
