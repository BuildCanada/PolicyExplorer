Here's how I'll fight to protect the economy, workers, and jobs from Trump's Trade War.

If President Trump forces Canada to implement retaliatory tariffs, New Democrats will fight to ensure every dime Canada collects goes directly into the hands of workers.

Trump should not confuse our kindness for weakness.

In Canada, we take on bullies by having each others backs - that's who we are.
