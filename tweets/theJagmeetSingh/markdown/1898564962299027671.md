**OFL (@OFLabour):** Today we kicked off International Women’s Day at the annual Spratt breakfast, where OFL Executive Vice-President @JackieOfl joined unions, labour leaders, and the community to celebrate the strength and resilience of all women. This year, @theJagmeetSingh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, joined us to honour the leadership of women in the labour movement.

As always, we were honoured to celebrate the legacy of Mary Spratt, a @SteelworkersCA and fierce trade unionist who knew that women’s voices and power were essential to the fight for workers’ rights. Her legacy reminds us that equality isn’t given, it’s won through organizing, solidarity, and action. A powerful start to International Women’s Day! #IWD2025 #OnLab #OnPoli
