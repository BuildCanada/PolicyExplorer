This week I joined @UniforTheUnion and @psac_afpc workers at Best Theratronics who've been on strike for 200+ days.

These workers are just next door to Pierre Poilievre's riding - and he hasn't bothered to show up.

In 20 years as a career politician, Poilievre has never stood on a picket line - where workers stand up to the Big Bosses.

Instead, he hangs out in mansions, takes cheques from CEOs, and turns his back on workers.

You can always count on me to stand up for working people.
