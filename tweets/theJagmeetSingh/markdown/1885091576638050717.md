Build Canadian. Buy Canadian.

We need to fight like hell to protect Canadian jobs from Donald Trump.

Our plan will ban American companies from all federal government procurement contracts if Canadian workers can do them.

And permanently change Canadaâ€™s procurement policies to favour unionized and Canadian companies.

Canadian workers first - always.
