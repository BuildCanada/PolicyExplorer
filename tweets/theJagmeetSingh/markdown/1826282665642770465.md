As Canadians, we take care of one another.

We won't let anyone divide us by tearing apart who we are and what we value.

In Halifax and across this country - having each other's backs is just who we are.

That means making sure all Canadians have access to dental care and pharmacare - and not letting the Conservatives cut, gut and take it away.
