Today marks 30 years without clean water for Neskantaga First Nation.

30 years of children suffering with rashes.

10 years ago, the Liberals made another empty promise to Neskantanga First Nation, yet they’re still waiting.

Now the Liberals fight communities like theirs in court to deny they even have a right to clean water.

I won’t back down. I’ll never stop fighting until every community trusts the water coming out of their taps.
