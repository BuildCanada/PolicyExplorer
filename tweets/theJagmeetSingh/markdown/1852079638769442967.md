Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil.

It is a reminder of the resilience and strength for Hindu, Jain and Buddhist communities.

As families gather to light lamps and come together, we should all commit to working together to build a better, more just country for all.

Happy Diwali and Deepavali!
