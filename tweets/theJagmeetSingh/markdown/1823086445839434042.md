From its inception, Pride has been a time for celebration, joy, and resistance against 2SLGBTQIA+ oppression and hate. 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

Thank you to everyone I met at Montreal Pride - I felt honoured to take part.

To the 2SLGBTQIA+ community in Canada I want you to know - you are loved and I will fight with you, always.
