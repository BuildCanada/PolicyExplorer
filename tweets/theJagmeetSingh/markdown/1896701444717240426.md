The things about Canada we are most proud of didn't happen by accident - they happened because New Democrats fought for them.

We fought the NDP Dental Care Plan - and today, over 1 million people have received care.

Together, we did that - with your support.

We can strengthen health care and defend it from Pierre Poilievre's threats to cut it and give more to billionaires.

I will do everything in my power to stand up for you - and together, nothing can stop us.
