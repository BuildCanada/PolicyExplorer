Pierre Poilievre is a cheerleader for Netanyahu's brutality.

Justin Trudeau offers nothing more than thoughts and prayers.

As Prime Minister, I would act for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. 

I would impose a 2-way arms embargo and sanction Netanyahu's war cabinet.

Everyone deserves peace and justice.
