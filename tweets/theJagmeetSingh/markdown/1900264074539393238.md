On behalf of all New Democrats, I wish everyone celebrating a joyful Purim!

Today, we celebrate the strength and resilience of Jewish people in Canada and around the world.

We stand in solidarity wth the Jewish community against rising antisemitism and commit to building a world free from hatred in all its forms.

Happy Purim! Chag Purim Sameach!
