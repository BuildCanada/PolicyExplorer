This morning, a mass bomb threat was sent to over 100 synagogues and Jewish community centers across the country. 

Threats like this are not only despicable and cowardly â€” but must be taken with the utmost seriousness.

To the Jewish community in Canada: I stand with you.

Antisemitism and hate have no place in our country.
