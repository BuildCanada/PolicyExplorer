After 9 years of NDP-Liberals, 1 out of 3 families in Kingston struggle with being able to put enough food on the table.

Parents are even forced to skip meals to feed their kids. What a disgrace for our country.

Call an axe the tax election now to bring home lower prices, so our families can afford to eat, heat, and house themselves: https://t.co/GHnhi3SRBM
