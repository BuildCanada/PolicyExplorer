My deepest condolences to the family of His Highness Prince Karim Al-Hussaini, the fourth Aga Khan, and the millions of Ismaili Muslims in Canada and around the world as they mourn the loss of a great spiritual leader and philanthropist who helped improve the lives of millions, irrespective of their religious affiliations or origins.

May he rest in peace.
