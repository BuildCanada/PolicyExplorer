This country has given me everything. Nowhere else would my story be possible.

I was born to a 16-year-old single mom, who put me up for adoption to two schoolteachers. They taught me that the promise of Canada was that anyone from anywhere can achieve anything. 

This country kept that promise to me. 

Now I want to restore that promise for all Canadians, so hard work again gets everyone a great life in a beautiful house on a safe street under our proud flag.

Let's put Canada first - for a change: https://t.co/US1RijukVK
