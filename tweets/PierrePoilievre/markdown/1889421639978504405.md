**John Barlow (@JohnBarlowMP):** Today we celebrate Canada's Agriculture Day, a day to honour our incredible farmers, ranchers, producers and processors across the country.

Thank you for all that you do to help feed Canada and the rest of the world! 🚜🍁🌾🐄🌽

I look forward to a common-sense Conservative government that unleashes the full potential of Canadian agriculture, where hard work, innovation, and farming traditions thrive!
