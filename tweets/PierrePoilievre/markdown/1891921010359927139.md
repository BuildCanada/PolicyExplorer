The Carney-Trudeau Liberals promised to cut spending on outside consultants.

They DOUBLED it. 

Last year, after promising to cut consultants again, they boosted spending by another 13% while Carney was Trudeauâ€™s top economic advisor.

Now they will promise all over again.

They are lying now just as they lied then.
