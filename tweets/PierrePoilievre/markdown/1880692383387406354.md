Carbon Tax Chrystia Freeland has made Canada weak & dependent on the Americans for everything. Her tax hikes have driven $500 BILLION of Canadian investment to the U.S. Her military cuts & weak borders threaten our safety.

Now, President Trump spots her weakness and Canadians are paying the price.

Fire Freeland. Take back control of borders and taxes and put Canada First.
