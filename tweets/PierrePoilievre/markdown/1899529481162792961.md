**Larry Brock (@LarryBrockMP):** Mark Carney is bringing in none other than former Trudeau Justice Minister David Lametti. 

Let’s not forget, this is the same guy who:
❌ eliminated mandatory minimum sentences for serious violent crimes, including gun crimes and repeat offenses.
❌ allowed house arrest for violent criminals, including those convicted of sexual assault, human trafficking, and robbery with a firearm.
❌ weakened bail conditions, making it easier for repeat violent offenders to get out of jail quickly.
❌ lowered penalties for serious crimes, including terrorism-related offences, kidnapping, and drug trafficking.

Mark Carney = 4 more years of Trudeau’s crime, chaos, and disorder.
