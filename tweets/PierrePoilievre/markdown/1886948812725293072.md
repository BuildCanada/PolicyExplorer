397 strikes, you’re out! But woke Liberals’ catch-and-release, hug-a-thug laws turn him loose to terrorize our people.

## Quoting Tweet

**Toronto Police Association (@TPAca):** How many more chances do repeat violent offenders get before meaningful change happens? Thanks to @TPS22Div Major Crime unit for re-arresting this individual. 397 total charges, including assault, assault with a weapon, dozens of break-and-enters, and multiple failures to comply. This is yet another example of why we need real bail reform NOW.
