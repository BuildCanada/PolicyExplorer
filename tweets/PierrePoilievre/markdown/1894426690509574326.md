Yesterday, Liberals showed they are going to protect Carney from any tough questions. 

Freeland even jumped in to save him for his “we agree with Hamas” gaffe. 

We got no answers about his new carbon tax, his past opposition to pipelines, the terrible job he did as Trudeau’s economic advisor, his sneaky budget accounting or his moving jobs out of Canada. 

Team Trudeau is installing him to get a fourth Liberal term. Canadians are not stupid. They won’t be fooled.

Sign here to stop Carney, if he wins, Canada loses: https://t.co/StFW0QKviq
