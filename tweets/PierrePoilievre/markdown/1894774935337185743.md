Mark Carney said he had nothing to do with Brookfield moving their HQ out of Canada to Trump's hometown of New York City.

Why did Mark Carney lie about his decision to sell out Canadian jobs?

Carney was chair of Brookfield's board when they unanimously voted to move their headquarters out of Canada to New York City - Trump’s hometown. 

Here is the letter he wrote to shareholders urging them to approve the move on December 1, 2024.
