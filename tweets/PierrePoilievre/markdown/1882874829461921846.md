The workers at Trenton's EastCut Wood Building Solutions want to axe the tax so they can build more homes. 

Our common sense plan will lower the costs of materials and building by axing the carbon tax while also making housing more affordable by axing the federal sales tax off new homes to save Canadians up to $50,000.
