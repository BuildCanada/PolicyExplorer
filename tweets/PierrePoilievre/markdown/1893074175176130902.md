**Tracy Gray (@TracyGrayKLC):** “We have to remember that this is part of the radical drug experiment that the BC NDP, supported by the federal Liberals, have been doing for years".

The BC NDP admitted Conservatives were right and finally accepted the evidence that taxpayer-funded drugs were flooding our streets and ending up in the hands of gangs and organized crime where the most vulnerable of Canadians were given dangerous opioids without supervision.

It’s appalling the Liberals have allowed this deadly experiment to continue for so long.
