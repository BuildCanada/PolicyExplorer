Lincoln Alexander was a soldier, a lawyer, and a trailblazer as the first Black Canadian Member of Parliament.

Today, with his granddaughter Erika Alexander, our common sense Conservative candidate in Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas, we honour his extraordinary legacy and celebrate his lasting impact on our country.
