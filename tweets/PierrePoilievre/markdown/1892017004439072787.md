Here we go again: Trudeau-Carney Liberals giving your tax dollars to city politicians who hike homebuilding taxes. That is why our youth cannot afford homes after 9 years of this government.

I will axe the sales tax on new homes and require cities to cut their homebuilding taxes to get federal funds.
