My message to Canadian families tonight:

We will be there for you. And we will unite as Canadians to protect our affected sectors.

Now is the time to take back control and relaunch our economy so that we can confront President Trump's unjustified threats and tariffs from a position of strength.

We will do this for our people, for our land, for our home, for Canada first for a change.
