## Quoting Tweet

**CDN Building Trades (@CDNTrades):** Weâ€™d like to thank @PierrePoilievre for listening to the concerns of Canadaâ€™s Building Trades Unions and addressing long-standing policy asks, which he has committed to delivering if elected this morning, including:

âœ… Reinstating Apprenticeship Grants of up to $4,000 to support the next generation of skilled tradespeople.Â 

âœ… Expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program (UTIP) â€” With a goal to train 350,000 workers and ensure smaller unions and locals have access to funding for up to 75% of project costs.Â 

âœ… Creating Rapid EI Payouts for pre-registered apprentices to better support workers as they upgrade their skills to earn bigger paychecks.

âœ… Nationally Harmonizing Health & Safety Regulations which will promote interprovincial labour mobility, and keep workers safe across Canada.

We are grateful for Pierre Poilievre's commitment to improving the lives of workers, and as a non-partisan organization, we encourage all candidates and parties to put their focus on policies and programs that uplift our members and all construction workers, protect high-quality union jobs, and ensure Canadian workers earn bigger paychecks to support their families.
