**Jasraj Singh Hallan ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ (@jasrajshallan):** Chrystia Freeland backed the job-killing capital gains tax hike and lied to Canadiansâ€” claiming it only impacts the wealthiest 0.13%.

Reality is lawless tax hike punishes workers, farmers, fishers, physicians, tradespeople, and small businesses.

Only now that it benefits her Liberal leadership run is she speaking out against it.

The Liberal government must cancel this job-killing tax hike and CRA must not collect it!
