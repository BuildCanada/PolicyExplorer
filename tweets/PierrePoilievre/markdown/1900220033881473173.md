**Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer):** Serious question: Why isn’t the Canadian Media doing any due diligence on Mark Carney?

Last week, the Financial Times posted an article digging into Brookfield’s shady accounting while Mark Carney was in charge. 

Yet no Canadian media has dug into this, and Mark Carney is hiding from questions about his shady business dealing. 
In fact, the Liberal PR specialists at the CBC have gone out of their way not to mention Brookfield for over two weeks now. 
When will Canadian media dig into Mark Carney’s shady business practices, or even pressure him to finally take some questions?
