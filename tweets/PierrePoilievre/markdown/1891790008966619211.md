Why I’m doubling down:

Everything Conservatives said BEFORE the Trump tariffs is even MORE correct now: 
- Axing the carbon tax
- Scrapping the capital gains tax hike
- Repealing the anti-energy law C-69
- Approving pipelines
- Celebrating—not cancelling—our history

These made sense before—they are absolute necessities now.
