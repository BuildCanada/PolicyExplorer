**Brad Wall (@BradWall306):** Cdn companies face a potential 25% Trump tariff (tax) on their exports to the US - this fellow prescribes a hidden carbon tax or a â€˜shadow carbon priceâ€™ on those same ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ companies making them even less competitive:

Trump Tariff + Carney Carbon Tax

### Quoted in Retweet

**David Jacobs (@DrJacobsRad):** "We need to use, effectively, a shadow carbon price."

A 'shadow carbon price' is nothing more than an at source carbon tax. Mark Carney isn't getting rid of the carbon tax, he's just trying to hide it from consumers.

Why is that important? Follow me on a Net Zero journey.ðŸ§µ
