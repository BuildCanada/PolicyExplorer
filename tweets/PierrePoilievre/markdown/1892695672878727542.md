The atrocities of Hamas' barbaric October 7th attack on the Jewish people are felt painfully today.

Oded Lifshitz, Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas will never hug their families again. They were murdered at the hands of the genocidal death cult Hamas. 

Conservatives call once again for all hostages to be released, and for the remains of Judih Weinstein, who was also murdered at the hands of Hamas, to be returned to her family.
