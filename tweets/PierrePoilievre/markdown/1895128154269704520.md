**Chris Warkentin (@chriswarkentin):** BREAKING NEWS! 

Liberal Nature Resources Minister was caught saying that Carney’s decision to move his Canadian company to the United States was the right decision because “his job is to act in the best interest of shareholders”. 

Sorry, what? 

The Liberals have made things so bad for Canadian businesses that they now believe it’s better for these companies to just move to the US? 

It’s clearly time to end this insanity and elect a Conservative government who will fight to keep Canadian jobs in Canada!
