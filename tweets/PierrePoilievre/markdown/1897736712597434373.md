Carbon Tax Carney is sneaking in a carbon tax con job. 

Common sense Conservatives will: 
✅ Axe the carbon tax for everyone, for good
✅ Slash bureaucracy, corporate welfare, useless consultants and foreign aid to bring down debt, taxes and inflation
✅ Take the GST off new homes to save you up to $50,000
