For countless generations, Nowruz has given families a chance to turn from the darkness of the past - and look with hope to brighter days ahead.

As communities gather across the country to welcome the spring, we strive for a future where Canadians of all faiths and backgrounds can live in peace and security.

Happy Nowruz!
