As Leader of Canada’s common sense Conservatives, I have always been clear, we stand with Ukraine in its defence against Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion.

I also firmly believe that the future of Ukraine must be determined by the Ukrainian people.

Conservatives will always stand on the side of freedom and democracy.
