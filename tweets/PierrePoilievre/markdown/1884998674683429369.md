Two Predictions:

1. Any minute now, a Liberal journalist will report that Carbon Tax Carney will reverse himself and suspend the Liberal carbon tax until after the election and that he is repeating Trudeauâ€™s 2015 broken promise to cut middle-class taxes.

2. Carbon Tax Carney would bring back an even bigger carbon tax if he ever won the election.
