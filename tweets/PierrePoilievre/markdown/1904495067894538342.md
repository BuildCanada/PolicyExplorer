Canada‚Äôs mighty workers want a change to put our country first.

I am in awe of you, the people who build our country, and it would be my privilege to work for you.

**Victoria Mancinelli üéóÔ∏è (@vcmancinelli):** I am not surprised by this endorsement by the Boilermakers and I am sure this will not be the last across the labour movement.  

@PierrePoilievre has taken the time to genuinely listen to the concerns of workers and translate them into action, working for the betterment of the men and women who build Canada and power us forward with a strong economy and policy to invest in and support workers. A plan to put Canada first.

Rank and file members will have a large say in this election and it would be wise for all to listen. Look no further than the province of Ontario and the historic collaboration with labour unions and a conservative government- a testament to what can be achieved when we work together
