**Margaret McCuaig-Johnston (@M_Johnston1):** This is good news: Poilievre would buy 2 polar icebreakers, double the size of the Rangers &amp; build a military base in the Arctic, as long as current coast guard &amp; other vessels underway would still be built. Funding from getting out of AIIB: good move. We need Arctic subs too.
