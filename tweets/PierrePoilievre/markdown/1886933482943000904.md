2 years ago, I warned of the deadly consequences of liberalizing fentanyl and other hard drugs in this video.

The NDP-Liberals attacked me for it.

If only they'd listened, we wouldn't be living this nightmare now.

Ban the drugs. Shut down the drug dens. Lock up the traffickers. Secure the borders. Treat addiction.
