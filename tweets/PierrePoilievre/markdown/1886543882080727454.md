Like Canadians across the country, Conservatives are relieved to hear that there will be a one month pause on tariffs from the United States that would have hurt workers, families and businesses on both sides of the border.

But this is not a time to sit back. We must urgently work to strengthen Canadaâ€™s economy and do everything we can to ensure these tariffs are never brought in.

Liberals must recall Parliament NOW and put country over Party so that we can put Canada First.
